    "input": "Specific neuroleptics suppressed head twitching (HT) in mice, provoked by d,1-5-hydroxytryptophane (200 mg/kg i. p.) in doses starting from 0.00025 mg/kg (spiroperidol). L-DOPA and piribedil inhibited HT in doses from 25 and 50 mg/kg respectively, whereas apomorphine and d,1-amphetamine in doses of 1 up to 10 mg/kg exerted ambivalent activity. HT was significantly attenuated by clonidine in doses from 0.25 mg/kg, whereas by noradrenaline, isoprenaline and naphthizine, injected into the brain ventricles, in doses of 1 microgram, and 0.025 microgram per mouse respectively. Destruction of brain catecholaminergic neurons by intraventricular 6-hydroxydopamine (50 micrograms per mouse) caused a strong enhancement of HT. However, partial protection of the adrenergic (but not the dopaminergic) neurons by pretreatment with desipramine or similar drug AW 15,1129 eliminated the protective effect of 6-hydroxydopamine. It is concluded that there is the dopaminergic link in the mechanism of HT and that the stimulation of the central adrenoreceptors inhibits HT.",

    "instruction": "What was used to restore normal responsiveness to amphetamine in p-chlorophenylalanine-treated rats?",
    "input": "In the rat, d-amphetamine sulfate (15--80 mg/kg) causes numerous behavioral effects including simultaneous side-to-side head weaving or head tremor, forepaw padding and splayed hindlimbs. These signs are strikingly similar to a behavioral syndrome caused by intense serotonin (5-HT) receptor activation. Experiments were designed to determine whether some of the numerous effects of amphetamine on behavior can be ascribed to actions of the drug on 5-HT mechanisms. Catecholamine depletion with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine did not prevent the amphetamine syndrome. However, 5-HT depletion with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine or with p-chlorophenylalanine did prevent the syndrome. The degree of syndrome inhibition by p-chlorophenylalanine was correlated with the extent of 5-HT depletion. Normal responsiveness to amphetamine in p-chlorophenylalanine-treated rats was restored by 5-hydroxytryptophan, the precursor of 5-HT. Furthermore, methysergide, a 5-HT receptor blocker, prevented the amphetamine syndrome, whereas catecholamine blockers, phenoxybenzamine and pimozide, were ineffective. The results suggest that when amphetamine causes the signs of the syndrome it does so by activating 5-HT receptors in the brain, probably by displacement of endogenous 5-HT.",

    "instruction": "What happened to reflex bradycardia when 5-HT contents in the brain were elevated with 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) after peripheral decarboxylase inhibition with Ro 4-4602?",
    "input": "The vasopressor and bradycardia responses to an intravenous dose of epinephrine were assessed in saline-controlled, 5-hydroxytryptamine-(5-HT) depleted, and 5-HT-potentiated rats. Regardless of the previous treatment epinephrine produced an insignificant change in the basal levels of mean arterial pressure and heart rate. However, brain serotonin alteration did produce some influences on the reflex bradycardia in response to an elevation in arterial pressure. Elevating 5-HT contents in brain with 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) after peripheral decarboxylase inhibition with Ro 4-4602 produced a significant reduction in reflex bradycardia compared to the controls. In contrast, depleting 5-HT contents in brain with either p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) led to an enhancement of epinephrine-induced bradycardia. Moreover, the enhanced reflex bradycardia induced by PCPA treatment was readily blocked by the replacement of the depleted brain 5-HT with 5-HTP and Ro 4-4602. The results suggest that serotoninergic systems play a role in the elaboration or modulation of reflex bradycardia. Specifically, 5-HT appears to inhibit reflex bradycardia since its depletion facilitated and its elevation inhibited reflex bradycardia.",
    "output": "Elevating the 5-HT contents in the brain with 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) after peripheral decarboxylase inhibition with Ro 4-4602 resulted in a significant reduction of reflex bradycardia compared to the controls. This suggests that serotoninergic systems may inhibit reflex bradycardia."

    "instruction": "What was the effect of quipazine on serum prolactin levels in male and female rats?",
    "input": "Administration of a new specific serotonin uptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, depressed the firing rate of raphe neurons. A highly significant increase in serum prolactin levels was observed after ip injection of 30 mg/kg of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) in male or female rats pretreated with 10 mg/kg (ip) of fluoxetine. Neither 5-HTP nor fluoxetine given separately had any effect on serum prolactin levels. In animals pretreated with methysergide the combination of fluoxetine and 5-HTP did not increase significantly serum levels of prolactin. In addition, the serotonin agonist quipazine elevated significantly serum prolactin levels in male and female rats. The results of this study strengthen the idea that 5-HTP is acting via serotonin-containing neurons that influence anterior pituitary prolactin release, and that serotonin receptor activation leads to prolactin release.",
    "output": "The context indicates that quipazine, a serotonin agonist, significantly elevated serum prolactin levels in both male and female rats. This suggests that quipazine stimulates the release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland, possibly through activation of serotonin receptors."

    "input": "The effects of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) precursors, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and tryptophan on alpha- and gamma-motoneuron discharges were examined in the spinal cat with a deafferented cord. The injection of 75 mg/kg of dl-5-HTP resulted in a doubling of the spontaneous discharge rate of gamma-motoneurons and the induction of spontaneous alpha-motoneuron activity. These effects of 5-HTP were reversed by the 5-HT antagonists, cinanserin (4 mg/kg) and methysergide (2 mg/kg). Tryptophan alone (100 mg/kg) exhibited minimal effects of motoneuron activity, but in animals pretreated with pargyline it significantly excited alpha- and gamma-motoneurons. Recordings of alpha- and gamma-motoneuron activity in gastrocnemius and semitendinosus nerves revealed that 5-HTP increased alpha- and gamma-motoneuron activity in both flexor and extensor nerves. Reversal of the effects of 5-HTP by 5-HT antagonists suggests that these effects were mediated by 5-HT. The fact that the 5-HTP effects were observed in preparations with an open gamma-loop indicates that the effects on the alpha-motoneurons are not mediated via the gamma-motoneuron facilitation, but results from a central activation.",
    "output": "Tryptophan, on its own, did not have a significant effect on motoneuron activity in animals that were not pretreated with pargyline, according to the provided context. However, in animals pretreated with pargyline, tryptophan exhibited an effect of exciting alpha- and gamma-motoneurons. This suggests that the effects of tryptophan on motoneuron activity may be dependent on other factors or conditions, such as the presence of pargyline."

    "input": "In 10 day-old female and male rats, administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) induced a prompt elevation in plasma prolactin (Prl) and growth hormone (GH) levels. Pretreatment with 2 serotonin (5-HT) receptor blockers, methysergide (Meth) and metergoline (MCE), markedly reduced the 5-HTP-induced Prl rise but failed to alter the GH response to 5-HTP. Administration of 2 selective inhibitors of presynaptic 5-HT reuptake, 3-(p-trifluoromethylphenoxy)-N-methyl-3-phenyl-propylamine and chlorimipramine (CIM), potentiated the 5-HTP-stimulated Prl rise but significantly reduced the 5-HTP-induced GH release. Blockade of dopaminergic or alpha-adrenergic receptors by pretreatment with pimozide (Pim) or phentolamine (Phent), respectively, or central sympathectomy by intraventricularly (i.vt.) injected 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) were capable of reducing the 5-HTP-induced GH release without affecting the 5-HTP-induced Prl rise. These data indicate that in the infant rat the 5-HTP-induced Prl release is mediated via the brain 5-HT system and that a nonspecific activation of the catecholaminergic system is responsible for the GH response to the drug.",
    "output": "The effect of pretreatment with methysergide and metergoline on the 5-HTP-induced GH response in 10 day-old rats was not altered. While these 5-HT receptor blockers markedly reduced the 5-HTP-induced prolactin rise, they did not affect the growth hormone response to 5-HTP."

    "instruction": "What was the effect of pretreatment with reserpine on the dose-response curve to 5-HT in the isolated posterior communicating artery of the cat?",
    "input": "5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) induced dose-dependent increases in tension on the isolated posterior communicating artery (PCA) of the cat were significantly antagonized by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD, 6 X 10(-9). In the presence of the phentolamine (10(-6) M) the contraction induced by the two lowest doses of 5-HT was significantly reduced. Pretreatment of the animals with reserpine (3 mg kg-1, i.p., total dose) did not modify the dose-response curve to 5-HT except for the lowest dose. Removal of both superior cervical sympathetic ganglia 15 days before the experiment brought about a significant increase in the vasoconstriction induced by 5-HT at all the doses compared with the control. Cocaine (10(-6) M) induced a significant shift to the left of the dose-response curve to 5-HT but the maximum response was the same as in the control. The augmented response to 5-HT after denervation was partially antagonized by LSD (6 X 10(-9) M) but not by phentolamine (10(-6) M). These results show that the vasoconstriction elicited by 5-HT in the PCA of the cat is mainly due to direct stimulation of tryptaminergic receptors. The participation of an indirect adrenergic component in the contractile effects of 5-HT seems to be negligible.",
    "output": "Pretreatment with reserpine had a minimal effect on the dose-response curve to 5-HT in the isolated posterior communicating artery (PCA) of the cat. Only the lowest dose of 5-HT was significantly affected by reserpine pretreatment, showing a reduced contraction compared to the control group. This suggests that reserpine, which depletes catecholamine stores, did not significantly contribute to the contraction induced by 5-HT in the PCA of the cat, indicating that the vasoconstriction elicited by 5-HT is mainly due to direct stimulation of tryptaminergic receptors, with a negligible participation of an indirect adrenergic component."

    "instruction": "What is required for 5-HTP to alter behavior in 5,7-DHT-treated rats?",
    "input": "The serotonin precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), can induce a behavioral syndrome characterized by rigidity, splayed feet, tremor, head weaving, salivation and forepaw treading. This response to 5-HTP was markedly potentiated in adult rats treated intracisternally with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) during development. Prevention of the 5,7-DHT-induced reduction of brain norepinephrine with pargyline or desipramine did not diminish the potentiation of 5-HTP, suggesting that noradrenergic fibers are not contributing to the altered 5-HTP response. It was also found that treatments with 5,7-DHT potentiated the release of prolactin and the disruption of responding in a fixed-ratio operant task induced by 5-HTP. Other experiments indicated that 5,7-DHT treatments potentiated 5-HTP without affecting the action of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine. In addition, administration of the decarboxylase inhibitor, R0-4-4602, at a dose that inhibits enzyme activity in brain, blocked the 5-HTP-induced behavioral syndrome in 5,7-DHT-treated rats, indicating that 5-HTP must be converted to serotonin for 5-HTP to alter behavior. Thus, the present studies indicate that destruction of serotonergic fibers during development can produce permanent changes in central serotonergic mechanisms.",
    "output": "For 5-HTP to alter behavior in 5,7-DHT-treated rats, it must be converted to serotonin. This conversion is necessary for the 5-HTP to affect behavior. The destruction of serotonergic fibers during development in these rats produces permanent changes in central serotonergic mechanisms, which may contribute to the altered response to 5-HTP. Additionally, noradrenergic fibers do not seem to contribute to this altered response, as treatments with pargyline or desipramine to prevent the 5,7-DHT-induced reduction of brain norepinephrine did not diminish the potentiation of 5-HTP."

    "input": "Intracisternal injection  of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) following treatment with desmethylimipramine induced development of behavioral supersensitivity to the intraperitoneally administered serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) in the mouse. This behavioral syndrome, characterized by tremor and muscle twitches (myoclonus), showed a clear dose-response relationship with 5,7-DHT as well as with 5-HTP. Mice lesioned with a low dose of 5,7-DHT (20 micrograms) or a placebo were treated repeatedly with a protein synthesis inhibitor, sycloheximide (45 mg/kg, s.c., every 12 h for up to 10 days). This treatment resulted in a reversible decrease of cerebral protein synthesis varying between 70 and 20% with time between treatments. The myoclonic response to 5-HTP in animals pretreated with 5,7-DHT and by cycloheximide showed a decrease in intensity within 24 h when evaluated quantitatively by an electronic activity monitor, the results of which were confirmed by direct observation. Cycloheximide also exerted a similar, though smaller, effect following full development of sensitivity to 5-HTP over 10 days. These effects may de mediated by inhibition of rapidly turning over serotonin receptor proteins, although their interpretation is somewhat obscured by possible toxic effects of cycloheximide.",
    "output": "The context does not provide information about the route of administration for sycloheximide. However, it mentions that the protein synthesis inhibitor was administered subcutaneously (s.c.) every 12 hours for up to 10 days.

    "input": "1 Control rats given L-tryptophan (100 mg/kg) showed a smaller increase of brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) than its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). However, when brain 5-HT concentrations were depleted by 40-50% after treatment with the synthesis inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) (150 mg/kg) L-tryptophan caused a considerable increase in 5-HT but no change in 5-HIAA. Similar results were obtained following depletion of brain 5-HT by pretreatment with p-chloroamphetamine (10 mg/kg).2 Electrical stimulation of the median raphe nucleus of control rats significantly increased 5-HIAA in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and striatum. However, stimulation of PCPA (200 mg/kg) pretreated animals did not significantly increase 5-H1AA either 24 or 72 h after administration of the drug.3 Pretreatment of rats with PCPA (200 mg/kg) increased striatal synaptosomal uptake of [(3)H]-5HT by 30% and reduced 5-HT concentration in the rest of the brain by 62%.4 PCPA (150 mg/kg) markedly reduced the acute behavioural response (-76%) to p-chloroamphetamine (10 mg/kg) although brain 5-HT was only moderately reduced (-36%). L-Tryptophan (100 mg/kg) given 15 min before p-chloroamphetamine restored both brain 5-HT and the behavioural effects of p-chloroamphetamine in PCPA pretreated rats and enhanced the behavioural response to p-chloroamphetamine in control rats.5 The results suggest that newly synthesized 5-HT is less rapidly metabolized in rats with low brain 5-HT. The possible reasons for this and the relevance of the results to the use of L-tryptophan in the treatment of depressive illness are discussed.",

However, it is mentioned that brain 5-HT concentrations were depleted by 40-50% after treatment with PCPA (150 mg/kg). Therefore, we can infer that the depletion of brain 5-HT after treatment with PCPA (150 mg/kg) was approximately 40-50%.\n\nIt is important to note that this information is inferred from the context and not explicitly stated, so it may not be entirely accurate.

Ultrastructural observations in one case showed numerous lysosome-like organelles that were similar to those described for granular cell myoblastoma, but were identical to those described for the granular cell variant of ameloblastoma, a tumor that frequently resembles basal cell carcinoma. Additional features included tonofilaments and desmosomes, both of which support an epithelial origin for the granular cells in this rare variant of basal cell carcinoma.",

Moreover, atypical malignant mesenchymal cells and vascular spaces were present. The individual cytoplasmic organelles are not considered to be specific to particular types of cell as seen from the discussion of the significance of rough endoplasmic reticulum, microfilaments and lysosomes. Only examination of the composite pattern of subcellular organelles allows the differentiation of certain cell types.

Only the terminal band 21q22 was not in triplicate. G-, Q-, R-, and C-banding techniques and silver nitrate staining of the nucleolus organizer regions (NORs) were used to identify this chromosome fully. The phenotype of the patient was not typical for Down's syndrome, providing additional evidence that trisomy of band 21q22 is pathogenetic for the phenotype of Down's syndrome. This is also a new example in human pathology of a stable 'dicentric' chromosome in which one of the centromeric constrictions appears to be nonfunctional.",

Among the 293 women referred because of advanced maternal age (40 years and above), there were 11 (3.8%) who had affected fetuses, while among the 439 aged 35 to 39 years there were 6 such women (1.4%). In the 112 mothers referred because of a history of a previous child with Down's syndrome, one fetus (0.9%) with trisomy 21 was detected. Of 27 cases in which one parent was a carrier of a balanced chromosomal rearrangement, two chromosomally abnormal fetuses (7.4%) were detected (the offspring of maternal carriers), and a further two spontaneous abortions occurred before the scheduled amniocentesis. In the 22 cases with a history of sex-linked disorder, there were 8 males. Nine women were referred with a possible inherited metabolic defect: one fetus affected with congenital adrenal hyperplasia was detected. The number of metabolic referrals was markedly less than in overseas studies. The finding of XXY, XXX and trisomies of chromosomes 13, 18, and 21 in fetuses of older mothers confirms the increased risk in such mothers for chromosome abnormalities in addition to trisomy 21. Sixty-two of the 1000 women (6.2%) had to have a repeat amniocentesis because of failure of culture. Of 900 births: one case of maternal cell contamination and one case of unconfirmed mosaicism were the only disparities between prenatal and postnatal karyotypes.

There is no reason to relate hard manifistation of the Down syndrome with the detected translocation. The influence of the mathernal non-devision in the meiosis and the rise of the trisomy 21 is discussed. In the following pregnancies it is advisable to amniocentesis.",
    "output": "Given the mother's carrier status of the reciprocal translocation (46, XX, rep (10;12)), there is a risk of passing this abnormality to future offspring. To minimize this risk, it is recommended that amniocentesis be performed in subsequent pregnancies. This procedure allows for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus, including the translocation, and can help guide decisions about the continuation of the pregnancy. It's important to note that the decision to proceed with a pregnancy after a positive test result should be made in consultation with a genetics counselor and healthcare provider."

The children each have an unbalanced form of the translocation with partial trisomy for 20p. Extensive gene marker studies have been unable to affix any specific gene locus onto the short arm of chromosome 20. The balanced translocation was inherited from the maternal grandfather. Two phenotypically abnormal deceased members of the family are believed to have had the unbalanced trisomy 20p condition. An increases number of spontaneous abortions were possibly due to lethal unbalanced 20p deletions. The moderate to mild mental retardation and somewhate unusual features (round face, prominent cheeks and nose, short mandible) in the three siblings and two other affected relatives suggest that trisomy of the short arm of chromosome 20 may cause a distinguishable clinical syndrome. Vertebral abnormalities and abnormal dermatoglyphics are part of the picture. Clinical and cytogenetic findings of all reported cases are compared.",

This means that she has a normal number of chromosomes (46) and carries a translocation where a piece of chromosome 13 has been exchanged with a piece of chromosome 20, specifically from the long arm (q) of chromosome 13 to the short arm (p) of chromosome 20. However, it's important to note that she is clinically normal, but her translocation was inherited and led to the unbalanced form in her children, resulting in their mental retardation and other distinctive features."

Incubation of sliced of endometrium at 37 (but not at 0 degrees) with 3H-testosterone results in the binding of the steroid by chromatin. On the other hand, testosterone-cytoplasmic receptor complex is able to associate with chromatin at 0 degrees. Chromatin did not bind free 3H-testosterone under these conditions. The existence of the receptor for testosterone in endometrial cells promoting its transport into the nucleus and binding with chromatin corroborates the previously shown specific action of testosterone on messenger RNA biogenesis in the uterus. Polyinductor model of regulation of gene expression in higher organisms by steroid hormones is discussed.",

Progesterone-binding macromolecules from cytosols of both mammary neoplasms exhibited sedimentation coefficients of 3.5 to 4.0 S on sucrose gradients of either low or high ionic strength. From Scatchard analyses of titration data, apparent dissociation constants of 4 to 6 X 10(-8) M were determined for ligand-binding protein complexes from either tumor. Specific progesterone-binding capacities varied considerably, ranging from 150 to 650 fmoles/mg of cytosol protein. Optimal binding of [3H]progesterone was reached by 2 to 3 hr at 3 degrees, pH 7.4, and then decreased rapidly. Specificity studies indicated that cortisol, corticosterone, and triamcinolone acetonide competed effectively for [3H]progesterone-binding. This suggested that [3H] progesterone was bound largely to a macromolecule distinct from transcortin, which does not bind glucocorticoids containing 9alpha-fluoro groups. Aldosterone, as well as several androgens and estrogens, were weak competitors of binding except at high concentrations. The nature of the inhibition of progesterone-binding sites by triamcinolone acetonide and corticosterone was competitive. Concurrent titrations of [3H]progesterone and [3H]triamcinolone acetonide-binding sites demonstrated that their binding capacities were similar, considering the relative stabilities of the complexes. These results, which indicated that progesterone and glucocorticoids compete for the same binding site, suggest that these hormones may influence mammary gland differentiation and development by a common mechanism.",

These components bind the respective hormones with high affinity (saturating at 4-8 nM) and sediment with rates typical of presumed steroid receptors (4.0-4.5 S in 0.15 M NaCl, 5.0-7.5 S without salt). A 90-95% reduction in androgen binding found in the androgen-insensitivity mutant mouse, testicular feminization (Tfm), provides a genetic control for the specificity of binding. This reduced androgen binding with Tfm/Y mutants and blocking experiments with non-radioactive estradiol [estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17beta-diol] and testosterone (17beta-hydroxy-4-androsten-3-one) indicate the existence of at least two binding components: one with high affinity only for estradiol, the other with affinity for both androgens and estrogen. Based on these properties, a receptor mechanism that detects relative concentrations of androgens and estrogens is proposed.",

Binding conducted at 4 degrees C was found optimal after 72 hours of incubation in 5 mM Tris-Maleate buffer pH 6.4 with 25 mM CaCl2. Injecting estrone (25 microgram/100 g B.W.) for one week induced the formation of lactogenic receptors, and increased the specific binding of hGH from 2.8 +/- 1.9 to 22.3 +/- 7.1%. Prolactin and hGH, but not rGH or other pituitary hormones, could displace radioactive hGH. With incubations conducted at 37 degrees C, equilibrium was reached more rapidly but at the cost of a more extensive degradation. The presence of membrane receptors in the medium partly protected the hormone against aggregation and degradation. Scatchard plots were obtained from experiments conducted under optimal conditions and analyzed on computer using a program based on an iterative method.

The high-affinity aldosterone sites can be distinguished from those sites which have a higher affinity for either [3H]dexamethasone (3H-DM) or [3H]corticosterone (3H-B) on the basis of selectivity for spirolactone SC-9420 or non-radioactive A, DM, and B. The binding of 3H-A to the receptors was maximal after 2 hours of incubation of 0-4C. No significant binding of 3H-A to the receptors could be demonstrated when incubations of the radioactive ligand were performed at either 20 or 37 C, indicating that the receptor is heat-liabile. Scatchard analysis of the 3H-A binding data over a 200-fold concentration range of 3H-A indicated that there are two binding sites for aldosterone, a high affinity component (a1) with a Kd approximately equal to 1.5 X 10(-9)M and a low-affinity component (a2) with a Kd approximately equal to 6.3 X 10(-8)M. A similar study using 3H-DM as the radioactive ligand demonstrated only one site for the 3H-DM binding with a Kd = 6.2 X 10(-9)M. The presence of specific aldosterone receptors in the brain with high affinity, limited capacity, and selectivity for aldosterone suggests a possible extra-renal mechanism of action of the hormone in or mediated through the CNS.",

After labeling of the cytosol fractions in vivo and in vitro we were able to demonstrate androgen-receptor complexes moving with an electrophoretic mobility (R(f) of 0.5 in 3.25% acrylamide gels containing 0.5% agarose and 10% glycerol. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used as a quantitative assay for androgen receptors in the tissues. The hypothalamus, preoptic area and brain cortex were found to possess a single class of high affinity binding sites for androgens and the dissociation constants (K(D) were estimated to be 3.4, 4.3 and 2.6 X 10 (-10M) respectively.

Like other androgen-receptor complexes, the testosterone-receptor complexes of the hypothalamus, preoptic area and brain cortex were temperature labile, sulfhydryl dependent and revealed a very slow rate of dissociation at o degrees C (t1/2 greater than 36 hr). The receptors in all the tissues had an isoelectric point of 5.8. The steroid specificity of the cytoplasmic androgen receptors was tested in vitro by the competing efficiency of different unlabeled steroids for (3H)-testosterone binding. In the three tissues in investigation the following order of affinity was found: DHT greater than T greater than Cyproterone acetate greater than progesterone greater than androstenedione greater than 17beta-estradiol. Cortisol did not effect androgen binding significantly.

After labeling of the cytosol fraction in vivo and in vitro, we were able to demonstrate androgen-protein complexes moving with an electrophoretic mobility (Rf) of 0.5 in 3.25% acrylamide gels containing 0.5% agarose and 10% glycerol. This method was used for quantitative measurements of pituitary androgen receptors, allowing multiple samples to be run simultaneously with little or no non-specific binding. There was no measurable dissociation of the androgen-receptor complexes during electrophoresis. When radioactive testosterone (1 nM) was added to pituitary cytosol fractions in vitro, there was an increase in the binding up to 4 hours of incubation at 0 C and little or no increase between 4 and 24 hours. All the binding studies therefore were done by incubation overnight at 0 C. When cytosol fractions were incubated with increasing concentrations of radioactive testosterone, a typical saturation curve was found. Scatchard plot analysis showed a binding capacity of 12.0 femtomoles/mg protein and the equilibrium constant of dissociation was estimated to be 3.4 +/- 0.7 (SD) X 10(-10)M. Like other androgen-receptor complexes, the testosterone-receptor complex in the anterior pituitary gland had an extremely slow rate of dissociation at 0 C (t1/2 greater than 4 days). The steroid specificity of the cytoplasmic androgen receptors was tested in vitro by the competing efficiency of different unlabeled steroids for [3H] testosterone binding. T and DHT caused the same inhibition of [3H]T to the receptors. However, since metabolism, of DHT to 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol occurred even at 0 C, the affinity of DHT for the receptor is probably somewhat underestimated. Cyproterone acetate had approximately half the affinity for the receptor compared with T, whereas lower affinities were found for progesterone and 17beta-estradiol. Cortisol did not appear to have any affinity for the receptors. Isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels showed a peak of bound radioactivity with an isoelectric point of 5.8.

Androgen metabolism was eliminated during receptor purification allowing determination of the kinetics of [3H]-androgen-receptor complex formation. In all three tissues, receptors were found to have essentially identical capabilities to bind androgen, with the affinity for [3H] dihydrotestosterone being somewhat higher than for [3H] testosterone. Equilibrium dissociation constants for [3H] dihydrotestosterone and [3H] testosterone (KD = 2 to 5 X 10(-10) M) were estimated from independently determined rates of association (ka congruent to 6 X 10(7) M-1 h-1 for [3H] dihydrotestosterone and 2 X 10(8) M-1 h-1 for [3H] testosterone) and dissociation (t 1/2 congruent to 40 hr for [3H] dihydrotestosterone and 15 h [3H] testosterone). Evaluation of the effect of temperature on androgen receptor binding of [3H]testosterone allowed estimation of several thermodynamic parameters, including activation energies of association and dissociation (delta H congruent to 14 kcal/mol), the apparent free energy (delta G congruent to -12 kcal/mol), enthalpy (delta H congruent to -2.5 kcal/mol), and entropy (delta S congruent to 35 cal col-1 K-1). Optimum receptor binding occurred at a pH of 8. Receptor stability was greatly enhanced when bound with androgen. Receptor specificity for testosterone and dihydrotestosterone was demonstrated by competitive binding assays. The potent synthetic androgen, 7 alpha, 17 alpha-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone, inhibited binding of [3H] testosterone or [3H] dihydrotesterone nearly as well as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone while larger amounts of 5 alpha-androstane-3alpha, 17 beta-diol and nonandrogenic steroids were required. Sedimentation coefficients of androgen receptors in all unfractionated supernatants were 4 and 5 to 8 S. Differences in sedimentation coefficients were observed following (NH4)2SO4 precipitation which did not influence the binding properties of the receptors. These results, together with measurements of3alpha/beta-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase activity in vitro, suggest that organ differences in receptor binding of [3H] dihydrotestosterone and [3H] testosterone in vivo result from relative differences in intracellular concentrations of these androgens rather than from differences in receptor affinities.",

Like the androgen receptors in the prostate and epididymis, it has a sedimentation coefficient of about 7 S at low ionic strength, is eluted in or close to the void volume on Sephadex G-200 gel filtration (Stokes radius greater than 80 A), has an isoelectric point of about 5.6-6.0 (mean) 5.8 and a relative mobility (Rf) of 0.4 in 3.25% acrylamide gels. Following the injection of 3H-labeled testosterone, T and DHT are bound selectively by the receptor. Relatively more [3H]T than [3H]DHT is present in bound and free fractions as well as in total testicular 105,000 g supernatant. Similar results are obtained from testicular incubations with equimolar amounts of [3H]T and [3H]DHT at 0 degrees C in vitro. Saturation of receptor sites is achieved by incubation of testis supernatants with increasing amounts of [3H]T at 0 degrees C. The number of available binding sites following post-hypophysectomy regression is estimated to be about 9 fmoles/mg protein, and the apparent equilibrium constant of dissociation is 7 X 10(-10) M. The temperature stability and sulfhydryl dependence of the testicular androgen receptor are similar to androgen receptors in other organs. Binding is destroyed by heating the supernatants at 50 degrees C for 30 min and by exposure to p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate (1 mM) at 0 degrees C for 60 min. Furthermore, like other androgen receptors, the half-time of dissociation of testicular androgen-receptor complexes at 0 degrees C is extremely slow (t1/2 greater than 35 h). Separation of seminiferous tubules from interstitial tissue showed that a major portion of these receptors were localized within the seminiferous tubules.",

    "input": "The potent synthetic androgen methytrienolone (R 1881), which does not bind to serum proteins, was utilized to characterize binding to receptors in human androgen responsive tissues. Cytosol extracts prepared from hypertrophic prostates (BPH) were utilized as the source of receptor for the initial studies. High affinity binding was detected in the cytosol of 29 of 30 samples of BPH (average number of binding sites, 45.8+/-4.7 fmol/mg of protein; dissociation constant, 0.9+/-0.2 nM). This binding had the characteristics of a receptor: heat lability, precipitability by 0-33% ammonium sulfate and by protamine sulfate, and 8S sedimentation coefficient. High affinity binding was also detected in cytosol prepared from seminal vesicle, epididymis, and genital skin but not in non-genital skin or muscle. However, similar binding was demonstrated in the cytosol of human uterus. The steroid specificities of binding to the cytosol of male tissues of accessory reproduction and of uterus were similar in that progestational agents were more effective competitors than natural androgens. Binding specificities in cytosol prepared from genital skin were distinctly different and were similar to those of ventral prostate from the castrated rat in that dihydrotestosterone was much more potent than progestins in competition. Thus binding of R 1881 to the cytosol of prostate, epididymis, and seminal vesicle has some characteristics of binding to a progesterone receptor. When the nuclear extract from BPH was analyzed, high affinity binding was demonstrated that conformed to the specificities of binding to an androgen receptor. Here dihydrotestosterone was a more potent competitor than progestational agents. Similar patterns of binding were detected in the crude nuclear extracts from seminal vesicle, epididymis, and genital skin but not in uterus, muscle, or non-genital skin. We conclude that the androgen receptor is not demonstrable in the cytosol of prostate, epididymis, or seminal vesicle of non-castrated men but can be measured in the cytosol of genital skin and the nuclear extracts of androgen responsive tissues. Because steroid hormones exert their major influence within the nucleus of target tissues, the measurement of nuclear receptor may provide valuable insight into the regulation of growth of target tissues.",

    "input": "In this study of 500 cases of bleeding from the upper digestive tract, the importance of emergency fibre endoscopy is emphasised. It is in fact the only way to demonstrate acute gastro-duodenal lesions which are very frequent, especially during post-operative intensive care. As far as treatment is concerned, the interest of gastric lavage with ice-cold drinks is emphasised in hemostasis. As far as surgery is concerned, the indications are now well known depending on the rate of transfusion during the first few hours and the etiology. In chronic duodenal ulcers, vagotomy, pyloroplasty and suture of the ulcer have always given good results. This is also the case with acute ulcers. On the other hand, in gastric ulcers, gastrectomy remains the treatment of choice. When bleeding is due to oesophageal varices, surgery is only indicated in exceptional cases.",

To find the correct diagnosis in acute situations the best is, to do emergency fiberoptic gastroscopy and in some special cases selective angiography. Without clear diagnosis the mortality rate in such cases will be too high.",

This cause of bleeding is poorly recognised and the exact occurrence rate can be determined by the general and routine use of fibroscopy during the haemorrhage. The diagnostic and physiopathological problems are discussed. Repositioning of the cardia with the fashioning of an effective anti-reflux mechanism invariably led to the suppression of these haemorrhages.",

This article describes a subgroup of patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding whose clinical outcome can be predicted at the time of endoscopy. In 28 of 317 patients who underwent endoscopy, a \"visible vessel\" was seen in an ulcer presumed to be the bleeding site. All 28 were later recommended for operation because of recurrent (86 per cent) or uncontrolled (14 per cent) hemorrhage. In contrast, 75 per cent of the remaining 289 patients in whom vessels were not seen, whether or not bleeding from ulcers, had single bleeding episodes managed medically. Since patients with a \"visible vessel\" can be expected to have uncontrolled or recurrent hemorrhage, surgical treatment should be considered at the time of endoscopy if such a vessel is seen.",

    "input": "The surgical treatment of duodenal ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract is reserved for specific complications of the ulcer, namely perforation, hemorrhage, obstruction of the gastric outlet, intractability, and recurrence following previous surgery. Though all persons with an ulceration share at least one symptom of the ulcer diathesis, the treatment of a specific patient's problem demands individualization so that the best-suited operative procedure will be performed. If patients are appropriately selected for surgical procedures, the success ratio is maximized, and the frequency of undesirable side effects minimized. We view the surgical procedure for duodenal ulcer not as an indication of failure of medical therapy, but as an appropriate treatment for specific complications of the disease. When indicated, curative procedures can be performed routinely with minimal chance of recurrence. Whenever an ulcer recurs, a specific plan of investigation will help differentiate incomplete vagotomy, endocrine tumors, or other common reasons for ulcer recurrence.",
    "output": "The specific complications of a duodenal ulcer that require surgical treatment include perforation, hemorrhage, obstruction of the gastric outlet, intractability (uncontrollable pain or bleeding), and recurrence following previous surgery. These complications can lead to serious health issues if not addressed promptly. However, it's important to note that the decision for surgery should be individualized based on the patient's specific condition. The surgical procedure for duodenal ulcer is not considered a failure of medical therapy, but an appropriate treatment for specific complications of the disease. Recurrence of the ulcer may require further investigation to identify the cause, such as incomplete vagotomy, endocrine tumors, or other common reasons for ulcer recurrence."

    "input": "Acute and/or recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due to ruptured gastric varices from an isolated thrombosed splenic vein is a distinct entity. Incidence of this syndrome is probably less than 1%. Typical clinical features of this syndrome include evidence of splenic hypertension without liver disease and no demonstrable cause of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Diagnosis can easily be missed unless the surgeon is familiar with this syndrome. Typical findings at the time of surgery are an enlarged spleen, varicose veins usually involving the upper third of the stomach, and pancreatic and peripancreatic inflammation. Portal vein and portal pressure will be normal. Meso-portography is a convenient and safe procedure and will lend support to suspicion when a retrograde nonfilling of the splenic vein is present. Splenectomy offers the expectation of a long-range cure. A representative case of a 39-year-old man is discussed. He had at least six episodes of gastric bleeding in less than 3 years. At a previous laparotomy, the cause of bleeding could not be determined. A splenectomy in December 1970 has been able to control the gastric bleeding since then.",

The factors influencing the mortality and the recurrent bleeding have been sought. The overall mortality was 29.5%. Age of patients and type of surgical procedure did not affect the mortality raate, while chronicity of lesions and their duodenal location had a favourable influence. Most deaths were due to hypovolemic shock and its complications. Gastric resection with vagotomy is the operation of choice for control of bleeding.

Abdominal complications of varying degree of severity were observed in 62 cases (16%). They were of four types: haemorrhage, ileus, peritonitis and complications on the part of the biliary tract and pancreas. The use of radiological methods for detecting these complications is reviewed. Direct roentgenography is the method of choice in cases of suspected ileus, perforation or foreign body. Administration of contrast media should be reserved almost entirely to cases of stress ulcer and to distinguish between incomplete and complete ileus. If perforation of penetration is suspected only water-soluble contrast media should be used. Detection of a leaking anastomosis or an abscess is by injection of the fistula. The value of angiography for  revealing a haemorrhage or embolism and for assessing the response to vasoactive agents is discussed.",

The major risk factor associated with cardiovascular disease has been found, from various epidemiological studies, to be elevated blood pressure. Therefore, a lot of energy has been expended in prospective therapeutic trials in attempting to detect whether treatment of high blood pressure is beneficial. In severe hypertension, where the risk to the individual is considerable, this benefit has been demonstrated with relative ease. However, it has not yet proven possible to show conclusive benefit of treatment in the mild group of hypertensives, which form the vast majority of patients seen in general practice. A different approach has been advocated where account is taken of other coincidental cardiovascular risk factors; their presence or absence should help the clinician decide whether to treat or not to treat in the individual case.",

    "input": "The pathogenesis and basic mechanisms of hypertension are not understood. Hypertension is now considered to reflect abnormality in one or more of the biologic systems that regulate flow and resistance. Its complications result from high intra-arterial pressure, and drug treatment substantially lessens these complications. The death rate from hypertension has dropped strikingly. Although current knowledge is not sufficient to develop predictably successful prevention programs, there is growing interest in applying available information. Epidemiologic studies have identified obesity as a major risk factor for hypertension; they have also been interpreted as showing that high dietary sodium intake causes hypertension in industrialized societies. Evidence on the role of obesity seems firm and can provide the basis for prevention programs. The role of sodium intake requires further study.",

    "instruction": "What type of thickening is characterized by the hypertensive vascular disease in the intima and media of the small arteries and arterioles?",
    "input": "Clinical, experimental and pathologic studies strongly indicate that hypertension is a major factor in coronary heart disease, sudden death, stroke congestive heart failure and renal insufficiency. The deleterious effect of the elevated blood pressure on the cardiovascular system appears to be due mainly to the mechanical stress placed on the heart and blood vessels. Humoral factors and vasoactive hormones such as angiotensin, catecholamines and prostaglandins may play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertensive cardiovascular disease but this role has not yet been defined and is probably secondary. Hypertension and the resulting increase in tangential tension on the myocardial and arterial walls, leads to the development of hypertensive heart disease and congestive heart failure as well as hypertensive vascular disease that affects not only the kidneys but also the heart and brain. Hypertensive vascular disease involves both large and small arteries as well as arterioles and is characterized by fibromuscular thickening of the intima and media with luminal narrowing of the small arteries and arterioles. The physical stress of hypertension on the arterial wall also results in the aggravation and acceleration of atherosclerosis, particularly of the coronary and cerebral vessels. Moreover, hypertension appears to increase the susceptibility of the small and large arteries to atherosclerosis. Thus the patient with hypertension is a candidate for both hypertensive and atherosclerotic vascular disease of the coronary and cerebral vessels leading to occlusive disease of both the large and small arteries and resulting in myocardial infarction and stroke. Other major complications of hypertensive vascular disease include rupture and thrombotic occlusion of blood vessels, especially in the brain. Disease of the arterial media, which begins in childhood with the deposition of calcium in the vessels, may be an important cause of arterial hypertension. This form of hypertension may manifest itself in adults as arteriosclerotic hypertension and lead to cardiovascular complications very similar to those of essential hypertension. The relation of arteriosclerotic hypertension to nutritional factors, including dietary salt intake, deserves study.",
    "output": "The thickening characterized by the hypertensive vascular disease in the context provided is fibromuscular thickening of the intima and media with luminal narrowing of the small arteries and arterioles. This thickening is a result of the hypertensive stress on the arterial walls, leading to the development of hypertensive vascular disease."

They found that postural hypotension in the elderly is quite different from that in young adults. A full study is difficult and the response to changes in posture are inconstant, this it is only possible to take into consideration changes in systolic blood pressure, and one should not neglect falls in blood pressure of low amplitude. This definition, once accepted, postural hypotension in the elderly is a frequent phenomenon which gives complex symptoms owing to the intrication of vascular disturbances and lesions of the central nervous system. Among the numerous permanent or occasional causes, more particularly those due to drugs, the role of hypovolemia seems to be of importance in orthostatic hypotension and should be sought as a routine.",

    "input": "With advancing age blood pressure rises in most populations with the exception of some isolated tribes. In western countries 30 to 40% of the people above the age of 60 years have casual blood pressure levels greater than or equal to 160/95 mm Hg. Advancing age per se produces a number of physiological changes related to blood pressure, such as a decrease in cardiac output, an increase in peripheral vascular resistance and a decrease in plasma renin-angiotensin-aldosterone levels. The mechanism causing the elevation in pressure with age are unknown though increased rigidity of the great vessels contributes to the rise in systolic pressure. There is a decline in the sensitivity of the baroreceptor reflex, but the contribution of this to the elevation of pressure has not be elucidated. Elderly patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension have a low cardiac output and high peripheral vascular resistance. The rise in blood pressure is associated with an increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality even in the elderly hypertensives. The available data on the efficacy of hypotensive treatment in the elderly is scanty. There are no data proving that hypotensive therapy prolongs life. Controlled studies on the prevention of organ damage especially cerebrovascular accidents are inconclusive, showing either a significant decrease or no effect. Isolated reports illustrate, however, that drastic blood pressure reduction can provoke serious side effects, thus decreasing the quality of life. Hypotensive treatment is indicated in elderly hypertensive patients with hypertensive retinopathy grade III or IV, congestive heart failure or cerebral haemorrhage, in elderly patients with a markedly elevated diastolic blood pressure (greater than or equal to 120 mm Hg) and a trial of hypotensive therapy should be offered in milder forms of hypertension when it is accompanied by certain specific symptoms such as angina, headache and dyspnoe. The management of elderly hypertensive patients is more difficult than in the young. General measures are often not well accepted. The dose adjustment of the hypotensive agent is more critical and volume depletion or orthostatic hypotension are more likely to occur.",

    "input": "Blood pressure readings are the central parameter in the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of arterial hypertension. Frequent measurements are therefore necessary because the blood pressures of healthy people, and in particular of patients with hypertension, are subject to considerable variability. Emotional factors, physical strain and diurnal differences have a modifying effect. Attempts to standardize a single measurement such as has been tried in the determination of the basic blood pressure or the diastolic levels have proved of little relevance for information on the daily blood pressure profile. The frequent determination of a random blood pressure after 2 to 3 minutes rest is a logical alternative. Regular monitoring is almost ideally obtained, especially under antihypertensive drug therapy, by the patient measuring his own blood pressure.",

The tumor associated antigens can be clinically useful as markers for detection of cancer and some may also mediate host resistance against tumor growth. Much emphasis has been placed on the detection of circulating tumor associated markers, with radioimmunoassays for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) being extensively utilized. At present, CEA does not appear to be promising for initial detection of cancer, but may find an important place in the determination of prognosis and early detection of recurrent disease. Many cancer patients have depressed immunologic competence, yet they frequently have cell-mediated immunity against tumor associated antigens. Several different immunotherapeutic strategies have been developed, to either augment the immunologic responsiveness of the patient or to specifically increase the immune reactivity against tumor associated transplantation antigens.",

In 21 of the 50 patients, CEA containing cells were found in a frequency ranging from 5 to 80% of the tumor cell population. The results were confirmed by radioimmunoassay of tumor extracts. No apparent relation was seen to cytologic type or grade of differentiation. HCG was detected by IF in 4 tumors with an apocrine cytologic cell type. The level of CEA in plasma was determined before treatment and followed for 2-6 months in 72 patients. CEA was the only measured serum parameter that correlated initially with size and extent of the localized tumor. It was too low to be of use for monitoring primary disease, but should be of value in early detection of metastasis. Posttreatment a low or decreased plasma CEA was seen more often in patients who had had curative treatment than in those given palliative radiation. No raised serum HCG levels were found. Raised serum liver enzymes did not predict the extent of the primary tumor but may be an indication of distant spread. Tumor CEA content and CEA plasma concentration were correlated, although not very strongly. This means that CEA, although present in the tumor, is not always released in measurable amounts.",

    "instruction": "What percentage of subjects with benign mastopathy had a pathological concentration of at least one antigen?",
    "input": "Five tumor markers can be simultaneously determined in the serum by radioimmunoassay: carcinoembryonal antigen (CEA), alpha-fetoprotein (alpha-FP), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), beta-subunit of HCG (beta-HCG) and kappa-casein. In a series of 935 healthy subjects, these antigens remain detectable or are detected within very precise limits. At the start of the clinical evolution of breast cancer, the incidence of pathological concentrations is increased as compared with the highest level observed in normal subjects. This high incidence is mainly due to a concomitant determination of CEA, kappa-casein, HCG and beta-HCG. The alpha-FP test is never positive, while the kappa-casein concentration is particularly high in the first clinical stages of breast cancer and with metastases. The concomitant determination of these tumor markers may be a biological element contributing to the diagnosis of neoplasia, although it is neither an absolute nor a specific criterium. Indeed, a pathological concentration of at least one antigen was observed in 5.5% of the subjects presenting with benign mastopathy. When metastases occur (25 patients), the incidence of pathological concentrations of at least one antigen increases: 88%, the absolute values of these levels increasing simultaneously. The determination of the antigen concentration therefore allows an evaluation of the extension of the disease. Surgical removal reduces the incidence of positivity of these antigens to 34%. Persistence of pathological levels seems to be related to a possibility of relapse or metastatic spreading. Finally, chemotherapy and radiotherapy applied on a tumor which is not excised, does not decrease the incidence of positivity of the tumoral markers, although their levels seem to fluctuate with the clinical evolution.",

A comparative evaluation of these antibodies with two immunological techniques has demonstrated a greater number of positive sera from cancer patients assayed by isotopic antiglobulin (25 of 27, or 92%) than by membrane immunofluorescence (12 of 17, or 71%). In the non-cancer control group, positive reactions were found in 11 and 31% by the two techniques, respectively. The specificity of such serologically reactivity has been demonstrated by adsorption with fetal liver cells. These detected antibodies are not restricted to a particular type of human neoplasm, but rather to the presence of cancer. Because of their relative capacity of discrimination between benign and malignant conditions and because the assay for their detection is relatively simple, these techniques may provide alternative methods for diagnosis or monitoring of cancer patients.",

In a population of 935 normal subjects these antigens were undetectable or found within precise limits. In patients with tumors of various origins the rate of pathologically elevated levels was 72% at the beginning of the clinical course (194 cases). This high rate was primarily due to the simultaneous measurement of CEA, betaHCG, HCG, and casein. AFP was of little importance. The simultaneous measurement of these tumor markers may be one biochemical element of diagnosis of carcinoma, although this criterion is neither absolute nor specific, as 14.7% of patients with non-neoplastic disorders (234 cases) were positive for one antigen. In the presence of metastases (112 cases) the rate of pathologic levels of at least one antigen was increased: 86% due to CEA and casein assay at the same time as their absolute levels were increased. Surgical removal reduces the rate of positivity of these antigens to 37%. As was shown in patients with breast cancer, the rate was 10% when the tumor had been removed at Stage N- and 54% when it was removed at Stage N+. Thus, the persistence of pathologic levels could be correlated with the capacity for recurrence or metastases.

We report here that sera of a large proportion of patients with ductular carcinoma of the breast have antibodies to cell surface and/or intracellular antigens of autologous tumor cells and include evidence that the antigens are absent from a considerable range of normal and other types of malignant tissues. In addition to testing of control sera, specificity of the reacting antibodies was investigated further by testing of sera with normal breast tissue and the absorption of sera from breast cancer patients with various normal tissues and cancer cells.

Elevated levels (greater than upper 95th centile of controls) were found as follows: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), 17%; pregnancy-associated alpha-macroglobulin (PAM), 16%; casein 14%; human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) 6%; alpha-foetoprotein (AFP), 1.5%. The prevalence of elevated CEA levels (but not other markers) was higher in patients with evidence of extra-thoracic tumour spread (23%) mainly due to anaplastic tumours and adenocarcinomas. A degree of concordance of elevated marker levels occurred with CEA, HCG, casein and AFP, but there was a striking discordance of elevated CEA and PAM levels. Simultaneous assays of CEA and PAM will detect the majority of patients with elevations of any of the markers studied, and are likely to be the most useful biochemical markers in following the response of lung tumours to therapy.",

Mitosis-inhibiting activity at each stage in the purification was tested in an in vitro assay system employing human epidermoid carcinoma cells in exponential growth phase and Colcemid (Ciba) for arresting mitoses. This assay system is much more rapid and convenient than conventional in vivo systems. By the procedure described, a 10,000-fold material purification of the active component has been obtained. This corresponds to a 3,000-fold purification measured by protein content, and a 300-fold increase in mitosis-inhibiting activity per unit we;ght. The active component is acidic, contains sugar residues and has gel chromatographic properties characteristic of a substance with molecular weight of approximately 20,000. On SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, however, three weak bands were found. The active component is resistant to trypsin and protease and stable between pH 6.0 and 8.5.

The intact cytochromes P-450 in this preparation were retained by Sephadex G-200. They could be resolved by anion-exchange chromatography into four fractions with 70--80% recovery of cytochrome P-450 and little or no conversion to P-420. In the process, the p-450 hemoproteins were separated from cytochrome b5, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, and hemoglobulin. Each of the four fractions of cytochrome P-450 could be further resolved by electrofocusing in polyacrylamide into numerous protein bands, more than eight of which stained for heme. Extracts from focused gels retained P-450 spectral character. Mixtures of the various fractions electrofocused additively. Added hematin focused only in the acidic region of the gels. Although these results indicate extensive heterogeneity in the cytochromes P-450, the complexities of electrofocusing in the presence of detergent warrants cautious interpretation. These methods, however, should provide a basis for subsequent chemical, physical, catalytic, and immunological investigations of the heterogeneity, and its significance.",

Of 275 confirmed pregnancies, 229 were successfully terminated without further abortifacient therapy. A successful outcome was often associated with episodes of vomiting, diarrhoea, and uterine cramps in the 24 hours after prostaglandin administration, but the incidence was related to prostaglandin dosage and gastrointestinal side-effects were more common after vaginal administration.

In a lower and middle social class population net pregnancy rates (life table) were five to six per 100 woman-years, of which about half were due to failure to take the tablets. Side effects other than menstrual disturbance were few. Norethisterone was the least likely of the three preparations to lead to discontinuation because of disturbance of menstruation. There were three ectopic gestations amongst 35 pregnancies in 4500 women-months of use. Ninety-five patients with varicose veins, 15 with a history of thrombophlebitis and 23 with a history of liver disease took progestogens without relevant untoward effects.",

To find out how many women-months of use were associated with the 35 pregnancies, we can divide the total number of pregnancies by the total number of women-months of use.\n\nSo, the calculation is: 35 pregnancies / 4500 women-months = 0.00777778 woman-months per pregnancy.\n\nHowever, this calculation does not give us a whole number of woman-months because it is dividing a smaller number (pregnancies) by a larger number (women-months of use). To get a whole number, we can multiply this decimal value by the total number of woman-months of use (4500) to find out how many woman-months were associated with the 35 pregnancies.\n\nSo, the calculation is: 0.00777778 woman-months per pregnancy * 4500 woman-months = 34.62 woman-months.\n\nTherefore, approximately 35 pregnancies were associated with about 34.62 woman-months of use of the progestogens."

The women were randomly allocated to two groups and given either three months' hormone treatment followed by three months' placebo or vice versa. An appreciable amelioration of all symptoms on placebo made it difficult to asses the genuine value of oestrogen treatment during the period of study. Both groups made a dramatic clinical improvement during the first three months. Nevertheless, the symptoms of the 15 women who received oestrogen first returned after the cross-over to placebo without any suggestion of a placebo response. In contrast, the other group who took placebo first did not deteriorate after changing to oestrogen. The menopausal index and the karyopyknotic index were not reliable guides to the need for oestrogen treatment. Hot flushes, however, were proportionately reduced on oestrogen and they seemed to be more readily eliminated in individual cases by oestrogen. The results of blood clotting studies indicated that natural oestrogen administration raised the levels of the extrinsic clotting factors VII and X and accelerated the prothrombin time. The findings were similar to those observed after three months synthetic oestrogen administration with oral contraception. Long-term studies and epidemiological surveys of the clinical incidence of thrombotic and other sequelae are needed before large-scale oestrogen replacement treatment can be recommended.",

Vabra endometrial aspiration biopsies showed no statistical differences between 25 treated and 28 untreated patients in the frequency of normal, inactive, hyperplastic or neoplastic specimens. The most common finding in the treated group was a secretory response, which suggests that progesterone exerts an antiestrogen effect even when estrogen is given on a continuing basis. There is evidence that the vaginal maturation index in the postmenopausal patient, although helpful in determining the current state of her systemic estrogen activity, may not reflect the effect of estrogen on the endometrium. Estrogen therapy has no absolute predictable correlation with endometrial histology. Thus, the information from routine endometrial curettage is essential to evaluate the status of all treated patients.

The enzyme has a pH optimum between 7.5 and 8.0, and has an apparent Km for phosphoprotamine of about 50 muM. The hydrolysis of phosphoprotamine is stimulated by salt, and by Mn2+. Hydrolysis of phosphoprotamine is inhibited by ATP, ADP, AMP, and Pi, but is not affected by AMP or cyclic GMP. The purified phosphoprotein phosphatase preparation also dephosphorylates p-nitrophenyl phosphate and phosphohistone, and catalyzes the inactivation of liver phosphorylase, the inactivation of muscle phosphorylase a (and its conversion to phosphorylase b), and the inactivation of muscle phosphorylase b kinase. Phosphatase activities against phosphoprotamine and muscle phosphorylase a copurify over the last three stages of purification. Phosphoprotamine inhibits phosphorylase phosphatase activity, and muscle phosphorylase a inhibits the dephosphorylation of phosphoprotamine. These results suggest that one enzyme possesses both phosphoprotamine phosphatase and phosphorylase phosphatase activities.

All of the acid phosphatase activity was eluted with a sodium acetate buffer and combined ionic strength-pH gradient into two peaks (E1 and E2). Both enzyme peaks were further purified with Sephadex G-200, which resulted in 700- and 1000-fold purification for E2 and E1, respectively. A total of 220 units (mumoles substrate/min) of E2 with a specific activity of 160 units/mg protein has been obtained in one run by this procedure. E1 has a high molecular weight (greater than 100,000) and shows preference for monophosphate ester substrates, is markedly inhibited by tartrate, and has a pH optimum near 5.

This phosphoprotein phosphatase has a pH optimum of 6.7, is unaffected by the sulphydryl protecting agent 2-mercaptoethanol, and requires a divalent cation for maximal activity. Of the various divalent cations tested, Mg2+ is the most effective in reactivating the EDTA-inhibited enzyme. The phosphatase is inhibited by sodium flouride, sodium oxalate, N-ethylmaleimide, ATP and ADP but is relatively insensitive to ammonium molybdate. Increased ionic strength of the reaction medium also causes a reduction in the enzyme activity, e.g., by 48% at 200 mM sodium chloride. The activity of the acidic phosphoprotein phosphatase did not change significantly at 48 h or 96 h post-orchiectomy when expressed per unit of nuclear protein. However, it is reduced by approx. 30% at these times after castration if based on DNA content.

    "input": "1. A soluble phosphodiesterase is present in mammalian tissues which rapidly hydrolyses enantiomorphs of rac-glycerol 1:2-cyclic phosphate, producing rac-glycerol 1-phosphate. 2. The enzyme has been purified up to 1700-fold by a combination of acetone precipitation and chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-50, Sephadex G-150 and hydroxyapatite. 3. The Km with glycerol cyclic phosphate as substrate is 7.2 mM, and the pH optimum broad (6.9--7.5). The molecular weight (by gel filtration) of the enzyme is approx. 35500. 4. The phosphodiesterase has no requirement for Ca2+ or Mg2+, but is stimulated by reducing agents (cysteine, dithiothreitol) and Fe2+. 5. The purified phosphodiesterase preparation also hydrolysed 3':5'-cyclic AMP, producing 5'-AMP exclusively, and 2':3'-cyclic AMP, forming 3'-AMP and 2'-AMP in the ratio 7:3. Bis-(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate was slowly hydrolysed, but other phosphodiesters tested were not attacked. 6. The phosphodiesterase is inhibited by theophylline and o-phenanthroline.

    "input": "Plasma membrane fractions I and II isolated from bovine corpus luteum contain phosphoprotein phosphatases. Enzyme activities associated with both membrane fractions showed pH optima in the neutral range and were most active with phosphoprotamine as the exogenous substrate. The enzyme activity was partially inhibited by Co2+, Zn2+ and Fe2+. Dithioerythritol, glutathione (reduced) and 2-mercaptoethanol stimulated the enzyme activity, whereas N-ethylmaleimide and N-phenylmaleimide were inhibitory. Similarly, various cyclic nucleotides and nuclsoside triphosphates also inhibited phosphoprotein phosphatase activities. The phosphatase activity was also observed with endogenous phosphorylated membrane proteins as substrate. The endogenous phosphorylation of membranes was rapid and attained a maximal level after 15--20 min of incubation. Initially endogenous dephosphorylation was also very rapid, but did not reach completion. In addition to phosphoprotein phosphatase, membrane preparations also possessed very active cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase activity. Phosphoprotein phosphatase activity from plasma membranes was solubilized by ionic and nonionic detergents. Optimal solubilization was achieved with 0.1% sodium deoxycholate. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of deoxycholate-solubilized fraction I and fraction II membranes resolved phosphoprotein phosphatase activity into two species with apparent sedimentation coefficients of 6.7 S (Mr 130000) and 4.8 S (Mr 90000).

    "input": "Under conditions used previously for demonstrating glycolytic oscillations in muscle extracts (pH 6.65, 0.1 to 0.5 mM ATP), phosphofructokinase from rat skeletal muscle is strongly activated by micromolar concentrations of fructose diphosphate. The activation is dependent on the presence of AMP. Activation by fructose diphosphate and AMP, and inhibition by ATP, is primarily due to large changes in the apparent affinity of the enzyme for the substrate fructose 6-phosphate. These control properties can account for the generation of glycolytic oscillations. The enzyme was also studied under conditions approximating the metabolite contents of skeletal muscle in vivo (pH 7.0, 10mM ATP, 0.1 mM fructose 6-phosphate). Under these more inhibitory conditions, phosphofructokinase is strongly activated by low concentrations of fructose diphosphate, with half-maximal activation at about 10 muM. Citrate is a potent inhibitor at physiological concentrations, whereas AMP is a strong activator. Both AMP and citrate affect the maximum velocity and have little effect on affinity of the enzyme for fructose diphosphate.",

The enzyme has a high isoelectric point of ca. 9 and appears to exist as a monomer with a molecular weight of 42,000 plus or minus 1500. It is neither stimulated by cyclic 3',5'-AMP, -GMP, -CMP or -ump nor inhibited by the regulatory subunit of rabbit muscle protein kinase (Reimann, E. M., Walsh, D. A., and Krebs, E. G. (1971), J. Biol. Chem. 246, 1986). In the presence of divalent metal ions, preferably Mg-2+ or Mn-2+, the enzyme readily transfers the terminal phosphate group of ATP to phosvitin, alphaS1B- and beta a-casein and an NH2-terminal tryptic peptide derived from beta a-casein, but not to protamine, lysine, or arginine-rich histones or to yeast enzymes such as phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase, or pyruvate carboxylase; serine and polyserine were also inactive as phosphate acceptors. Km values of 0.17 mM for beta a-casein and 0.2 mMfor ATP were determined at 10 mM Mg-2+. The urified yeast protein kinase also catalyzes the reverse reaction, namely, the transfer of phosphate from fully phosphorylated beta a-casein or its NH2-terminal peptide to ADP resulting in the formation of ATP. AMP, GDP, UDP, and CDP did not serve as phosphate acceptors in this reaction. As observed by Rabinowitz and Lipmann (Rabinowitz, M., and Lipmann, F. (1960), J. Biol. Chem. 235, 1043) both reactions have different pHoptima with values of 7.5 for the forward reaction (phosphorylation of the proteins) and ca 5.2 for the formation of ATP; both are differently affected by salts. Phosphorylation of beta a-casein with [gamma-32-P]ATP followed by digestion of the labeled protein with trypsin indicated that all the radioactivity was exclusively introduced in an NH2-terminal peptide possessing the unique sequence: Glu-Ser(P)-Leu-Ser(P)-Ser(P)-Ser(P)-Glu-Glu...(Ribadeau-Dumas, B., Brignon, G., Grosclaude, F., and Mercier, J.-C. (1971), eur J. Biochem. 20, 264). By subjecting beta a-casein and its NH2-terminal peptide to the combined action of almond acid phosphatease and purified yeast protein kinase, it was determined that the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions proceed randomly, i.e., all seryl phosphate residues are equally susceptible and that the rate of phosphorylation decreases drastically as the number of bound phosphate groups in the substrate diminishes.",

    "instruction": "What is the apparent affinity constant for fructose-6-P when both 1 mM AMP and 10 mM phosphate are present together?",
    "input": "The activity of yeast phosphofructokinase assayed in vitro at physiological concentrations of known substrates and effectors is 100-fold lower than the glycolytic flux observed in vivo. Phosphate synergistically with AMP activates the enzyme to a level within the range of the physiological needs. The activation by phosphate is pH-dependent: the activation is 100-fold at pH 6.4 while no effect is observed at pH 7.5. The activation by AMP, phosphate, or both together is primarily due to changes in the affinity of the enzyme for fructose-6-P. Under conditions similar to those prevailing in glycolysing yeast (pH 6.4, 1 mM ATP, 10 mM NH4+) the apparent affinity constant for fructose-6-P (S0.5) decreases from 3 to 1.4 mM upon addition of 1 mM AMP or 10 mM phosphate; if both activators are present together, S0.5 is further decreased to 0.2 mM. In all cases the cooperativity toward fructose-6-P remains unchanged. These results are consistent with a model for phosphofructokinase where two conformations, with different affinities for fructose-6-P and ATP, will present the same affinity for AMP and phosphate. AMP would diminish the affinity for ATP at the regulatory site and phosphate would increase the affinity for fructose-6-P. The results obtained indicate that the activity of phosphofructokinase in the shift glycolysis-gluconeogenesis is mainly regulated by changes in the concentration of fructose-6-P.",
    "output": "Under the conditions similar to those prevailing in glycolysing yeast (pH 6.4, 1 mM ATP, 10 mM NH4+), the apparent affinity constant (S0.5) for fructose-6-P decreases from 3 mM to 0.2 mM when both 1 mM AMP and 10 mM phosphate are present together.

    "input": "1. The properties of phosphorylase a, phosphorylase b, phosphorylase kinase and phosphorylase phosphatase present in a human haemolysate were investigated. The two forms of phosphorylase have the same affinity for glucose 1-phosphate but greatly differ in Vmax. Phosphorylase b is only partially stimulated by AMP, since, in the presence of the nucleotide, it is about tenfold less active than phosphorylase a. In a fresh human haemolysate phosphorylase is mostly in the b form; it is converted into phosphorylase a by incubation at 20degreesC, and this reaction is stimulated by glycogen and cyclic AMP. Once activated, the enzyme can be inactivated after filtration of the haemolysate on Sephadex G-25. This inactivation is stimulated by caffeine and glucose and inhibited by AMP and fluoride. The phosphorylase kinase present in the haemolysate can also be measured by the rate of activation of added muscle phosphorylase b, on addition of ATP and Mg2+. 2. The activity of phosphorylase kinase was measured in haemolysates obtained from a series of patients who had been classified as suffering from type VI glycogenosis. In nine patients, all boys, an almost complete deficiency of phosphorylase kinase was observed in the haemolysate and, when it could be assayed, in the liver. A residual activity, about 20% of normal, was found in the leucocyte fraction, whereas the enzyme activity was normal in the muscle. These patients suffer from the sex-linked phosphorylase kinase deficiency previously described by others. Two pairs of siblings, each time brother and sister, displayed a partial deficiency of phosphorylase kinase in the haemolysate and leucocytes and an almost complete deficiency in the liver. This is considered as being the autosomal form of phosphorylase kinase deficiency. Other patients were characterized by a low activity of total (a+b) phosphorylase and a normal or high activity of phosphorylase kinase in their haemolysate.",
    "output": "The effect of AMP on the activity of phosphorylase b in a human haemolysate is that it is only partially stimulated by AMP. In the presence of AMP, phosphorylase b is about tenfold less active than phosphorylase a.

    "input": "The alloantibody response of mice receiving cortical bone allografts was investigated. Such grafts were highly immunogenic, resulting in antibody responses at least as strong as those to skin allografts in the same combinations. The duration of the response to a single bone allograft was very prolonged (greater than 10 months). The antibody response was shown to be directed against H-2K, H-2D, Ia, and at least two non-H-2 antigens. Although the great majority of the parenchymal cells of the graft were dead, the immunogenicity of the graft required living cells, since bone that had previously been frozen and thawed was nonimmunogenic. By retransplanting bone allografts to a second recipient it was possible to demonstrate that the grafts remained immunogenic for at least 4 weeks after transplantation, indicating that the living immunogenic cells survived in the recipient for at least 4 weeks. Such cells may be certain cells of the cortical bone itself, or else residual bone marrow elements which adhere to the endosteal surface of the bone. The observation that a small subpopulation of living cells can provoke strong immune responses against a wide variety of antigens may have implications for understanding the immunogenicity of other types of allografts.",

Host pretreatment by antigen and antibody (Ag-Ab) 11 and 10 days before transplantation, respectively, was the most effective treatment regimen for prolongation of graft function; active or passive immunization alone increased survival only modestly. A late dose of antiserum administered to Ag-Ab-pretreated animals significantly shortened graft survival. Patterns of cellular responsiveness were measured serially by lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity; humoral immunity by Ab-lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity, capillary hemagglutination, and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Allograft rejection in animals of all groups was heralded in vitro by increasing immunological activity. All cellular and humoral responses were depressed consistently in Ag-Ab-pretreated recipients. Cellular but not humoral responses were decreased in Ag-pretreated hosts, while humoral but not cellular responses were decreased in Ab-treated animals. The results suggest that the in vitro determinants of immunological activity used in this study generally followed clinical patterns of rejection or enhancement of cardiac allografts in the rat. Recipient pretreatment with Ag and Ab is more effective in graft prolongation than treatment with Ag or Ab alone, and in vitro data suggest an additive effect of these two regiments.",

A quantitative immune reactivity score correlated with graft survival. Low scores prior to transplantation were found in five transfused dogs that did not reject their allografts. High scores prior to transplantation were found in four animals rejecting their graft and in one dog that survived after an abortive rejection episode.

Graft survival rate also was evaluated in 199 recipients with pretransplant antibodies reacting with 10 to 50 percent of panel cells and in nonsensitized patients. The results show that good graft survival can be obtained in many hyperimmunized patients, particularly in recipients of primary renal allografts (66 percent cadaver graft survival rate at 2 years). However, sensitization following rejection of an allograft appears to confer a less favorable prognosis. The nature of recipient presensitization and the precise specificity of each reactivity cannot always be explained. This is exemplified in three patients in whom broadly reactive lymphocytotoxic antibodies were not directed against HL-A antigens. Since the number of sensitized patients who await renal transplantation is increasing, there should be no hesitation in proceeding with transplantation, particularly with primary grafts. Emphasis, however, must be placed on frequent prospective recipient serum sampling so that transient high levels of cytotoxins do not escape detection and therefore can be easily selected out for cross-matching against potential donors.",

In both strain combinations, immunological reactivity of lymphoid cells from treated animals was demonstrated in local GVH reactions at the end of the treatment (i.e., 12 days after transplantation). Lymphoid cells isolated from long surviving (100 days) AVN recipients of non-H-1 different grafts did not react in the GVH test.

Cytotoxicity of the infiltrating cells was almost invariably greater than cytotoxicity mounted by recipient peripheral blood lymphocytes. Deletion studies confirmed previous work and suggested that T cells were primarily responsible for cytolysis in early acute rejection; non-T cells more often in late chronic rejection. Antibodies eluted from the grafts demonstrated both specific antidonor and nonspecific activity as well as cross-reacting anti-HLA activity.

Lymphocytes injected subcutaneously in small doses (0.3 and 3 X 10(6)) cells) immunized the recipients efficiently for a haemagglutinin response; however, the response developed in a much quicker tempo than the response after skin grafting.

CY or antigen given alone were ineffective. Anti-donor antibody activiy was routinely detectable in graft-bearing animals. Cell-mediated anti-donor immunity, although impaired, was still present in long-term survivors. These findings suggest that preservation of graft function and prolonged survival in antigen-CY-pretreated animals may be abetted by a combination of mechanisms including antigen-induced immunological enhancement, and deletion by CY of potentially reactive lymphoid cell clones. The use of CY in conjunction with donor antigen pretreatment may provide an additional increment of specific immunosuppression in clinical organ transplantation.",

All of these renal grafts were rejected in a hyperacute or markedly accelerated manner compared to the survival of comparable grafts in nonsensitized animals. Studies directed at the mechanism of this rejection revealed no circulating recipient antidonor antibodies by several serological assays. In contrast, mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLCs) and cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) assays demonstrated marked recipient antidonor lymphocyte reactivity that appeared after skin grafts, diminished during the tenure of the renal graft in the host circulation, and reappeared after removal of the rejected kidney.

In childhood, scoliosis is usually insidious and is rarely symptomatic. In later years, however, scoliosis leads to cardiopulmonary compromise, neurologic dysfunction, degenerative joint disease, and cosmetic deformities. Therefore, surgical correction is indicated in selected patients. Internal fixation with spinal fusion is more effective than fusion alone. Postoperative radiographs must be examined closely for general as well as orthopedic complications. Loss of correction and failure of hardware are signs of pseudarthrosis. Radiographic follow-up evaluation should include two views whenever possible.",

They can include conditions which are congenital, tumorous, traumatic, toxic, metabolic, inflammatory, degenerative, infectious, circulatory, mechanical, or psychoneurotic. In addition many of these combinations can be found in the problem now alluded to as \"spinal stenosis\". Even under this condition, spinal stenosis is classified as congenital and acquired. Under the acquired forms of stenosis there are degenerative, combined stenosis, spondylotic, postoperative, posttraumatic, and miscellaneous types such as that due to Paget's disease or fluorosis. A diagnosis of these conditions can best be made by an experienced historian and examiner since they are never clear-cut and sometimes it is a \"sixth sense\" of the physician which helps him make the diagnosis. The diagnosis, once suspected, can best be confirmed with proper laboratory tests including myelography and tomography. The treatment, of course, depends specifically on the pathology which is diagnosed. The surgical approach to lumbar spinal stenosis and nerve root entrapment is discussed in Chapter 15. Due to the work of Verbiest and others, much has been done to elucidate this confusing diagnostic area (1, 9). However, much more needs to be learned. We do not completely understand the pain receptors for discogenic pain as well as reasons why various forms of treatment seem to have a 60% success rate no matter what is done. One of the reasons that long-term results are so difficult to come by in this type of work is the fact that these patients cannot be easily categorized by a simple method such as the study of a long bone fracture and the acquisition of a large series with one type of treatment. There are so many psychogenic factors as well as multifaceted treatment regimes used by experts throughout the world that a perfect follow-up with controls is practically impossible. Hopefully, better standardization of diagnostic procedures, nonoperative and operative treatment forms, and analysis of long-term end results may be forthcoming in the future as we elucidate this confusing problem called \"low back pain\".",

The lack of awareness of the range of condylar movement is contributory to iatrogenic trauma. A classification of etiologic factors is proposed. The superimposition of one upon another can create a severe problem. The superimposition of two upon a third can create an unusually severe problem.",

    "instruction": "How many cases of lumbar discovertebral abnormalities had a history of exogenous trauma?",
    "input": "Lumbar discovertebral abnormalities thought to be due to endogenous or subclinical trauma were evaluated in 22 cases. These consisted of predominantly lytic areas due to intrabody disc herniation in five cases, broad zones of vertebral body sclerosis due to reactive osteitis in 11, and destruction of the vertebral endplates surrounded by diffuse sclerosis in six. Spinal biopsy and negative bacterial cultures were consistent with the diagnosis in eight cases. Follow-up roentgenograms and further clinical evaluation in the remaining 14 showed either no progression or changes consistent with trauma. Only four cases had a history of exogenous trauma. Intrabody disc herniations usually affected the upper vertebral body with characteristic sparing of the adjacent endplate. The sclerotic lesions tended to occur in the anterior portion of the vertebral body, with the inferior aspect of L4 most frequently involved. These may be confused with osteoblastic metastases, particularly if adjacent disc narrowing is minimal. The lack of progressive vertebral fragmentation helps to distinguish this condition from neuroarthropathy. Lesions characterized by destruction of the vertebral endplates and reactive sclerosis simulate infection; absence of a soft tissue mass and clinical signs of sepsis as well as lack of progression are important differential features.",

Its incidence in patients whose primary complaint was of backache was shown to be twice as great as that in the general population. There was also a significantly higher incidence of lower lumbar spondylosis in patients with previous osteochondrosis compared with those without.

    "instruction": "What was the molar ratio of triglyceride:phospholipid:cholesterol:cholesterol esters in the very low density lipoprotein of the control group?",
    "input": "Male rats were administered 1.5 ml safflower oil by gastric intubation 0, 4, and 8 hr after a 16 hr fast. Plasma, liver, and adipose tissue were collected 16 hr after the last fatty meal. Rats fasted for 16 hr served as controls. Following fat feeding, the fatty acid composition of the very low density lipoprotein, triglyceride, and hepatic triglyceride were similar, as were the percentages of 18:2 in the very low density lipoprotein and hepatic cholesteryl esters. The phospholipids of liver and plasma lipoproteins were similar in the control groups, except that more 16:0 was present in the plasma lipoproteins. After fat feeding, the plasma lipoproein phospholipids were enriched with 18:2 more than were the hepatic phospholipids. Furthermore, the percentage of 18:2 in phospholipid was much less than in triglyceride or cholesteryl esters. Clearly, esterified lipids of liver and plasma lipoproteins (very low density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, and high density lipoprotein), and to a lesser extent, adipose tissue, were enriched with 18:2 derived from dietary triglyceride fatty acid even 16 hr after the terminal meal. A major proportion of the very low density lipoprotein isolated by ultracentrifugation in zonal rotors from plasma of fat fed animals had a faster rate-zonal mobility than did the very low density lipoprotein isolated from plasma of control animals. The very low density lipoprotein isolated from plasma of fat fed rats contained fewer moles of phospholipids, cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters, relative to triglyceride than did the very low density lipoprotein from plasma of animals not receiving safflower oil. The molar ratio triglyceride:phospholipid:cholesterol:cholesterol esters in the very low denity lipoprotein was 100:42.0:22.1:44.5 in the control group and 100:35.4:17.8:19.5 in the fat fed animals. It is postulated that an important biochemical mechanism by which dietary triglyceride fatty acids consumed by the animal over a long period of time alter plasma concentrations of triglyceride, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters is the directive influence of plasma free fatty acid, derived from dietary triglyceride, on the secretion of very low density lipoprotein lipids by the liver.",
    "output": "The molar ratio of triglyceride:phospholipid:cholesterol:cholesterol esters in the very low density lipoprotein of the control group was 100:42.0:22.1:44.5.

    "instruction": "What was the substitute for drinking water in Diet 2?",
    "input": "The sequential pattern of lipid accumulation and associated biochemical changes were studied in two commonly used experimental models of nutritional fatty liver in rats. Female rats were maintained for 8 weeks on high fat, low protein diets containing adequate methionine and choline, and drinking water ad libitum (Diet 1), or deficient in methionine and choline and containing 20% ethanol as a substitute for drinking water (Diet 2). Histologically, there was a progressive increase in liver lipids, mainly in the periportal areas. Occasional foci of liver cell necrosis with lipogranuloma formation occurred in areas of severe fatty change. These changes appeared earlier and were more marked in rats maintained on Diet 2. Electron micrographs revealed large lipid droplets in the liver cells, which sometimes contained myelin figures. The mitochondria were enlarged, distorted and appeared as amorphous structures with disorientated cristae in rats on Diet 1, whereas they had a condensed conformation in rats maintained on Diet 2. Rough endoplasmic reticulum was fragmented and degranulated particularly in rats on Diet 1, and smooth endoplasmic reticulum showed hyperplasia and vesiculation in rats on Diet 2. There was a progressive increase in the total liver lipids and triglycerides in both the groups of rats. This fatty change was accompanied by a significant increase in hepatic 3-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, malate, 2-oxoglutarate, citrate, lactate, ammonia, glutamate, alanine and aspartate, and a significant decrease in oxaloacetate, urea and glucose concentrations. The mass action ratios for alanine aminotransferase, aspartate amino transferase, and glutamate dehydrogenase, generally moved in a parallel direction. Hepatic ATP content was considerably reduced accompanied by a decrease in [ATP]/[ADP] ratios and a significant increased in [lactate]/[pyruvate] and [3-hydroxybutyrate]/[acetoacetate] ratios. There was a corresponding decrease in the [NAD+]/[NADH] ratios both in the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments. These biochemical changes were particularly severe in rats maintained on Diet 1 and Diet 2 for 8 weeks. There was a very good relationship between impaired mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum functions, redox and phosphorylation states, and the relevance of their changes to the fate of fatty liver cells.",
    "output": "In the context provided, it is stated that Diet 1 had drinking water ad libitum (available freely), while Diet 2 had 20% ethanol as a substitute for drinking water. Therefore, the substitute for drinking water in Diet 2 was ethanol."

    "instruction": "What was the effect of hypophysectomy on the responsiveness of liver mitochondria to differences in dietary fat?",
    "input": "Studies are reported on the effects of diets containing fatty supplements with (A) a high concentration of arachidonate (46% concentrate of ethyl arachidonate), (B) a high concentration of linoleate (corn oil), and (C) an essential fatty acid deficient, fully saturated fat (hydrogenated coconut oil) upon lipid composition, membrane permeability, and enzyme activities of liver mitochondria of normal and hypophysectomized rats. The fatty supplements produced differences in the fatty acid composition of the liver mitochondria; hypophysectomy, in addition, influenced the neutral and phospholipid composition. Permeability, indicated by swelling properties, correlated generally with the degree of unsaturation and essential fatty acid content of the lipid of the mitochondria of the normal animals. The fatty supplements also influenced the enzyme acitivites of the mitochondria of the normal animals. The mitochondria of the hypophysectomized animals were less responsive to the differences in the dietary fat in both their swelling properties and enzyme activities. Although the relationship was complex, it appeared that the hypophysis was involved in the functions of essential fatty acids in liver mitochondria.",
    "output": "The effect of hypophysectomy on the responsiveness of liver mitochondria to differences in dietary fat was a decreased responsiveness. The mitochondria of the hypophysectomized animals were less responsive to the differences in the dietary fat in both their swelling properties and enzyme activities, compared to the mitochondria of normal animals. This suggests that the hypophysis, or pituitary gland, plays a role in the functions of essential fatty acids in liver mitochondria, as the responsiveness of the mitochondria to dietary fat changes was influenced by the presence or absence of the hypophysis."

    "input": "Fasting rats were infused with 10% Intralipid for 24 h (0.33 mL/h per 100 g body weight) and the plasma lipoproteins isolated and compared with those of fed animals and animals with bile duct ligatures as controls. There was a 6- to 10-fold increase in the free cholesterol and phospholipid content of total plasma in animals infused with Intralipid or with ligated bile ducts. The changes were largely restricted to the low density lipoproteins (d=1.019--1.063 g/mL) where free cholesterol and phospholipid increased 30- to 60-fold compared with fed control animals. Hydroxylapatite chromatography of the low density lipoprotein fractions of both Intralipid-infused and bile duct ligated animals yielded a subfraction which was rich in free cholesterol (27%), phosphatidylcholine (66%), and protein (6%); the latter was composed primarily of albumin and apo C proteins. The electrophoretic mobility and polyanionic precipitation properties of the abnormal lipoprotein were indistinguishable from those of lipoprotein X isolated from the animals with bile duct ligatures. The albumin in the abnormal lipoprotein from both groups of experimental animals was detected immunochemically only after delipidation of the lipoprotein. Twice as much of the lipoprotein X accumulated in Intralipid-infused than in the bile duct ligated animals. On rechromatography of the residual low density lipoprotein other subfractions could be isolated which possessed lipid and protein proportions intermediate between those of the lipoprotein X and of normal rat plasma low density lipoprotein. The activity of lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase was increased twofold in the Intralipid-infused animals when compared with control animals, but it decreased by 50% in the animals with bile duct ligatures. It is concluded that the unusual lipoprotein X accumulates in the plasma of Intralipid-infused animals owing to incomplete clearance of the exogenous phospholipid, which mobilized tissue cholesterol and in the form of vesicular particles serves as a lipid phase for apo C proteins. A comparable mechanism is suggested for the formation of lipoprotein X in the animals with bile duct ligature.",
    "output": "The context does not provide an exact percentage of phosphatidylcholine in the subfraction of low density lipoprotein from both Intralipid-infused and bile duct ligated animals. However, it does state that the subfraction from both groups was rich in phosphatidylcholine (66%), along with free cholesterol (27%) and protein (6%)."

    "instruction": "What percentage increase in liver cholesterol and triglycerides was observed in rats fed a very high level of dietary corn oil?",
    "input": "Four different experiments, one with cockerels and three with rats, are described which relate to the effect of dietary factors and/or exercise on serum and liver lipids as well as on serum lipoproteins. Several classes of lipoproteins were isolated by preparative ultracentrifugation, and their purity assessed by gel electrophoresis. The lipid composition and protein content of serum lipoproteins and tissue were also determined. Dietary cholesterol produced an enormous increase (200 fold) in serum very low density lipoproteins in cockerels. This lipoprotein was apparently of very large particle size because it failed to penetrate the spacer gel during disc electrophoresis. In rats fed a cholesterol-supplemented diet, the increase in very low and low density lipoproteins was relatively insignificant in comparison with the cockerels. However, in both species, the liver was overloaded with cholesterol. Further, the serum high density lipoproteins, HDL2 were greatly diminished in both species as a result of cholesterol ingestion for 7 weeks. As a possible explanation for these related observations, it was proposed that HDL2 was utilized in the formation of cellular membranes by cholesterol-burdened, hyperplastic livers. A very high level of dietary corn oil (40% by weight) caused drastic changes in rat liver lipid levels and in serum lipoprotein profiles. Specifically, liver cholesterol and triglycerides were increased about 200% over normal. In another experiment, tissue lipids and serum lipoprotein levels were determined in treadmill-exercised rats and in sedentary controls. Two levels (4 and 40%) of a fat mixture (1:1, hydrogenated coconut oil: corn oil) were used in this study. The serum cholesterol was unchanged in the 4 groups, while the serum triglycerides were reduced in exercised rats given 4% but not 40% fat as compared to respective controls. Rats fed 40% fat and exercised had near normal levels of liver lipids which was in sharp contrast to their sedentary controls. The low denstiy lipoproteins were surprisingly higher in exercised rats given high fat than in sedentary controls. It was suggested that the direct synthesis of these lipoproteins by the liver may be necessitated under unusual conditions. In conclusion, considering the central role of liver in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism greater attention should be focused on this organ in future experiments on the control of hyperlipoproteinemia.",

As a consequence of this it diminished secretion of endogenously formed tryglycerides and cholesterol from the liver into the blood and a changed lipid composition of lipoproteins of a very low density in the blood.",

A part of the animals were injected with protein hydrolysate every other day for a period of 140 days. The level of serum lipids-total cholesterol, beta-lipoproteins, phospholipids and total lipids was examined. They found significantly higher values in the animals, receiving cholesterol in comparison with the control animals-292.4:84.9; 139.4:59.3; 457.1:241.2; 105.5:62.0 respectively for, beta-lipoproteins, total cholesterol, total lipids and phospholipids. The administration of protein hydrolysate in a dose of 0,5 ml/100 gm of body weight affected favourably fat metabolism. The increase of serum fat-lipid components was less manifested in comparison with the nontreated atherosclerotic animals. The greatest difference was found in beta-lipoproteins (292.4:143.8) and total, lipids (457.1:300.8). Statistically significant difference was established in total cholesterol as well. (139.4:81.9). There was an impression that this effect was due to the protective action of aminoacids of the protein hydrolysate on the normal functions of liver and the favourable effect on the tunover of the administered cholesterol.",

    "input": "Polyunsaturated meat and dairy products were compared with their saturated counterparts to determine their usefulness in a fat-modified diet for hyperlipidemic persons and their spouses. These polyunsaturated animal products were produced by feeding cattle a supplement of oil droplets coated with denatured protein. As a result, the polyunsaturated fatty acid content was 27 to 28 per cent of the meat fat and butterfat; saturated fatty acids (C12:0 to tc16:0) were 18 to 19 per cent. Of the eleven free-living subjects three were normocholesteremic, three had type IIa hyperlipidemia and five had type VI (IIb). In the fourteen-week study, an adjustment period of three weeks was followed by two consecutive experimental periods of four weeks each, then by a three-week follow-up period. During the adjustment period, participants continued to follow their usual eating patterns. During both experimental periods all followed the same prescribed fat modified food pattern using polyunsaturated margarine and oil. Five participants ate polyunsaturated beef and dairy products during the first experimental period and their saturated counterparts in the second; six participants ate saturated products first, then polyunsaturated. During the follow-up period, all participants selected all their own food. Serum cholesterol levels in five participants who had not previously followed a fat-modified diet were reduced by 18 per cent with polyunsaturated animal products and 11 per cent with saturated products. Serum cholesterol in six participants, previously on a fat-modified diet, was not significantly changed with polyunsaturated products. In ten of eleven participants, serum cholesterol levels were an average of 6 per cent lower with polyunsaturated products than with saturated products. It is concluded that polyunsaturated animal products are suitable for use in fat-modified food patterns for reducing hyperlipidemia, with some restrictions in the amount of polyunsaturated animal fat and with the inclusion of polyunsaturated oil and margarine.",

The serum triglycerides were significantly lower in exercised rats fed the low fat diet, but not in those fed the high fat diet, as compared with corresponding controls. The liver lipids were vastly elevated in sedentary rats fed the high fat diet as compared with those fed the low fat diet. An interesting effect of exercise was reflected by the near normal liver lipid levels in rats fed the high fat diet and exercised. However, in these animals, the muscle concentration of cholesterol was significantly higher than that in all other groups. The very low density lipoproteins tended to be lower while the low density lipoproteins tended to be greater in exercised as compared with sedentary rats. It was suggested that the decline in very low density lipoproteins was due to decreased synthesis resulting from adaptive changes in the exercised animal. It was further postulated that the increase in low density lipoproteins was possibly due to increased synthesis necessitated by the need to enhance the catabolism and excretion of cholesterol in exercised animals.",
    "output": "The liver lipid levels in rats that were fed a high fat diet and exercised were significantly lowered compared to those that were only fed a high fat diet and were sedentary. This suggests that exercise can help reduce the adverse effects of a high-fat diet on liver lipid levels in rats. However, it's important to note that this effect was not observed in rats fed a low-fat diet. Additionally, the muscle concentration of cholesterol was significantly higher in exercised rats fed a high-fat diet compared to all other groups. The very low density lipoproteins tended to be lower, while the low density lipoproteins tended to be greater in exercised rats, which might be due to changes in synthesis and catabolism of cholesterol in response to exercise."

    "input": "The influence of treatment with polyunsaturated lecithin (EPL) and with saturated lecithin on the lipoprotein composition and fatty acid profile was investigated in 4 male chimpanzees. The animals were successively given 3 isocaloric diets containing the same amount of fat with a degree of saturation varying from 1 in the control diet to 0.2 in the diet enriched with polyunsaturated lecithin, to 4 in the diet enrich with saturated lecithin. The VLDL, LDL and HDL3 fractions were isolated by ultracentrifugal flotation; changes in their lipid and fatty acid composition were followed and their microviscosity was measured. The treatment with polyunsaturated lecithin increases the cholesterol esters and lysolecithin content in HDL3, presumably via activation of the enzyme LCAT. These modified HDL particles have a more fluid surface and a denser core and are susceptible to act as better cholesterol carriers. A complementary effect of this treatment is a decrease of the plasma triglycerides and VLDL concentration, an increase in the unsaturation ratio of the triglycerides which might take place via activation of triglyceride lipase. The saturated lecithin treatment increases the plasma VLDL and LDL concentrations and the triglyceride levels and increases mostly the saturation ratio of the cholesterol esters. These effects are likely to enhance the progression of atherosclerosis.",
    "output": "The treatment with polyunsaturated lecithin in the chimpanzees resulted in a decrease of the plasma triglycerides and VLDL concentration. This could be due to an increase in the unsaturation ratio of the triglycerides, possibly through the activation of triglyceride lipase. Additionally, the polyunsaturated lecithin treatment led to an increase in the cholesterol esters and lysolecithin content in HDL3, making these modified HDL particles better cholesterol carriers with a more fluid surface and denser core. On the other hand, the saturated lecithin treatment increased the plasma VLDL and LDL concentrations, the triglyceride levels, and the saturation ratio of the cholesterol esters, which may contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis."

One group of sera, including two anti-H-2.33 sera, exhibited cytotoxicity directed exclusively toward human B but not T cells from all donors. Absorption studies on human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) of B or T cell origin corroborated these findings. Some nonimmune sera showed similar characteristics, indicating that the observed reactions were not attributable to cross-reactivities between mouse H-2K or D specificities and human antigens coded by the HLA-A, B, or C locus. Another set of mouse sera (anti-H-2.28b and anti-H-2.31) was highly cytotoxic to both B and T cells of some donors but not of others, suggesting that activity in these sera may arise from cross-reactions between mouse and human specifities. A third set of anti-H-2 as well as normal mouse sera showed only background cytotoxicity when tested on human cells. The ability of the B cell cytotoxic mouse sera to block the human mixed lymphocyte culture reaction (MLR) was compared to that of appropriate human alloantisera with exclusive B cell activity or a rabbit serum raised against human B cells.

The alloantisera detected surface antigens present only on B cells and segregation studies demonstrated that the genes that code for these antigenic specificities were linked to the major histocompatibility complex. The reactivity of the alloantisera with splenic lymphocytes from a panel of strains representative of the currently known Ag-B groups showed that multiple specificities were present in two of the three antisera and that these specificities were shared by many inbred strains. The appropriate absorption studies showed, however, that each antiserum detected an unique specificity that was found only in those inbred strains that shared the same mixed lymphocyte reactivity (MLR) phenotype as the donor strain. The alloantiserum produced against the KGH strain inhibited the MLR reactions involving this strain only when it was used as the stimulating cell population.

One subject made factors to both antigens and the sixth reacted to neither. The antigens chosen are known to be under MHC-linked immune response (Ir) gene control in all animal species tested, with some strains being responders while others are not. The selective responsiveness, different between individuals, thus suggests that the response to these antigens in man is under Ir gene control.

    "input": "Fusion of cells of the mouse myeloma line, P3/X63-Ag8 with spleen cells from AKR/J mice immunized against C3H thymocytes or from (BALB/c x BALB.K)F1 mice immunized against AKR/J thymocytes gave rise to hybrid cell lines that continuously secrete antibodies specific for the Thy-1.2 and Thy-1.1 antigens, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies from four such cell lines were analyzed in detail. All were 19S IgM, and, in the presence of complement (C), had high lytic titers on T cells of the appropriate antigenicity. Their specificity was shown by lysis of thymocytes from Thy-1 congenic mouse strains, A/J(Thy-1.2) and A. Thy 1.1. Furthermore, they lyse only 60 to 70% of lymph node cells, suggesting cytotoxicity for mature T cells and not B cells. Treatment of peripheral lymphocyte populations with monoclonal antibody plus C eliminated effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes, their precursors, and the mitogenic response to Con A, but did not affect the response to LPS. Purified, fluorescein-labeled monoclonal anti-Thy-1 antibody could be used to distinguish T and B cells. Purified antibody coupled to Sepharose 6MB was used to separate viable T and B cells. Two independently isolated anti-Thy-1.2 hybridomas are indistinguishable and bind the same determinant whereas a third is unique and may bind a separate site.",
    "output": "The monoclonal antibodies analyzed in the context lyze approximately 60 to 70% of lymph node cells, suggesting that they are cytotoxic primarily towards mature T cells and not B cells. This is inferred from the fact that these antibodies have high lytic titers on T cells of the appropriate antigenicity and they do not lyse a higher percentage of lymph node cells, which typically contain a higher proportion of B cells compared to mature T cells."

    "input": "The expression of B-cell antigens on various cell populations was studied through the use of human alloantisera and with heteroantisera raised to preparations of the alloantigen bearing molecules isolated from B-cell lines. The allo-and hetero-antisera competed with each other in blocking experiments and gave closely parallel results, reacting with normal and leukemic B lymphocytes, monocytes, E-rosette-negative acute lymphatic leukemias, all acute and certain chronic myelogenous leukemias, and a minor population of cells in fetal spleen and liver. These highly immunogenic surface components appeared to comprise the dominant B- cell specific plasma membrane determinants. Neither type of antiserum reacted with any but a minor population of normal or pokeweed-mitogen-transformed T cells, fetal thymic lymphocytes, E-rosette-positive acute lymphatic leukemias, or Sezary-cell leukemia. Through the use of these antisera evidence was obtained that Fc-receptor-bearing Ig-negative lymphocytes were divisible into two groups according to the presence or absence of the B-cell antigens. Both hetero- and allo-antisera blocked binding of immune complexes or antibody-coated ox erythrocytes to Fc receptors on B cells. F(ab')2 fragments of the heteroantibodies strongly inhibited antibody-dependent cell-mediated killing.",

By cytotoxicity testing the presence of Ia-like antigens on monocytes was significantly diminished compared to the autologous B-lymphocyte population and has important implications in B-lymphocyte serology. The study indentified a number of human antisera obtained from multitransfused subjects and pre- and post-transplant organ recipients that were non-HLA and appeared to define monocyte-associated antigens.

    "input": "A group of alloantibodies are found in pregnancy sera which react with antigens present on B lymphocytes and monocytes but are not detectable on the vast majority of unstimulated T cells. This specificity distinguishes them from HL-A antibodies which react with both cell types. They were readily recognized through indirect fluorescent antibody analysis by employing the combination of B-cell lymphoid lines and normal peripheral blood T cells. Different sera gave a variety of patterns of reactivity with a panel of 11 lymphoid lines. Similar differential patterns were also observed with normal B cells from different individuals particularly after concentrating the B cells. The antibodies were also cytotoxic to B cells and this procedure gave parallel results to the fluorescence method. The pattern of reactions obtained indicated a very heterogeneous system similar to that for HL-A. Special study of certain of the sera provided evidence that the lymphocyte-defined determinants of the mixed lymphocyte reaction system were involved. For convenience the term HL-B has been employed for these antigens.",

    "input": "Isolated fat cells from rat epididymal adipose tissue were incubated with various lipolytic hormones in the absence and presence of the alpha-adrenergic blocking agent phentolamine. Lipolysis, stimulated by noradrenaline, isoproterenol, or ACTH, was inhibited dose-dependently by phentolamine. At concentrations of phentolamine where lipolysis was already inhibited, phentolamine had a biphasic effect on hormone-stimulated formation of cAMP. Low concentrations of phentolamine enhanced cAMP formation, while high concentrations inhibited cAMP. The additional increase of cAMP formation by phentolamine was only seen with maximally effective concentrations of noradrenaline, isoproterenol, and ACTH. Half-maximally effective concentrations were invariably inhibited by phentolamine. The activity of noradrenaline-stimulated adenylate cyclase of fat-cell plasma membranes was inhibited by phentolamine, whereas cAMP phosphodiesterase activity was unaffected.",
    "output": "Phentolamine had a biphasic effect on cAMP phosphodiesterase activity in fat-cell plasma membranes. At low concentrations, it enhanced cAMP formation, while at high concentrations, it inhibited cAMP. However, it's important to note that this effect was only observed with maximally effective concentrations of lipolytic hormones (noradrenaline, isoproterenol, and ACTH). Moreover, phentolamine had no effect on cAMP phosphodiesterase activity when tested alone. Instead, it inhibited the activity of noradrenaline-stimulated adenylate cyclase, which is responsible for the initial production of cAMP."

    "input": "The effects of the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine on the levels of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and the activity of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in isolated rat liver parenchymal cells were studied. Cyclic AMP was very slightly (5 to 13%) increased in cells incubated with phenylephrine at a concentration (10(-5) M) which was maximally effective on glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. However, the increase was significant only at 5 min. Cyclic AMP levels with 10(-5) M phenylephrine measured at this time were reduced by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, but were unaffected by the alpha-blocker phenoxybenzamine, indicating that the elevation was due to weak beta activity of the agonist. When doses of glucagon, epinephrine, and phenylephrine which produced the same stimulation of glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis were added to the same batches of cells, there were marked rises in cAMP with glucagon, minimal increases with epinephrine, and little or no changes with phenylephrine, indicating that the two catecholamine stimulated these processes largely by mechanisms not involving cAMP accumulation. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of homogenates of liver cells revealed two major peaks of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. These eluted at similar salt concentrations as the type I and II isozymes from rat heart. Optimal conditions for preservation of hormone effects on the activity of the enzyme in the cells were determined. High concentrations of phenylephrine (10(-5) M and 10(-4) M) produced a small increase (10 tp 16%) in the activity ratio (-cAMP/+cAMP) of the enzyme. This was abolished by propranolol, but not by phenoxybenzamine, indicating that it was due to weak beta activity of the agonist. The increase in the activity ratio of the kinase with 10(-5) M phenylephrine was much smaller than that produced by a glycogenolytically equivalent dose of glucagon. The changes in protein kinase induced by phenylephrine and the blockers and by glucagon were thus consistent with those in cAMP. Theophylline and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, which inhibit cAMP phosphodiesterase, potentiated the effects of phenylephrine on glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. The potentiations were blocked by phenoxybenzamine, but not by propranolol. Methylisobutylxanthine increased the levels of cAMP and enhanced the activation of protein kinase in cells incubated with phenylephrine. These effects were diminished or abolished by propanolol, but were unaffected by phenoxybenzamine. It is concluded from these data that alpha-adrenergic activation of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in isolated rat liver parenchymal cells occurs by mechanisms not involving an increase in total cellular cAMP or activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The results also show that phosphodiesterase inhibitors potentiate alpha-adrenergic actions in hepatocytes mainly by a mechanism(s) not involving a rise in cAMP.",
    "output": "The concentration of phenylephrine used to study its effects on cAMP levels and the activity of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in isolated rat liver parenchymal cells was 10(-5) M. This concentration was found to be maximally effective on glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis."

Isoproterenol and norepinephrine stimulated a rapid intracellular accumulation of cyclic AMP, which reached a maximum level of 20-30 times the control value by 5 to 10 min after addition of the drug. Isoproterenol was approximately ten times more potent in stimulating both alpha-amylase release and cyclic AMP accumulation than were norepinephrine and epinephrine, which had nearly equal effects on these two parameters. Salbutamol and phenylephrine were less effectivema parallel order of potency and sensitivity was observed for the stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in a washed particulate fractionmthe results suggest that these drugs are acting on a parotid acinar cell through a beta1-adrenergic mechanismmat the lowest concentrations tested, each of the adrenergic agonists stimulated significant alpha-anylase release with no detectable stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulationmeven in the presence of theophylline, phenylephrine at several concentrations increased alpha-amylase release without a detectable increase in cyclic AMP levels. However, phenylephrine did stimulate adenylate cyclase. These data suggest that, under certain conditions, large increases in the intra-cellular concentration of cyclic AMP may not be necessary for stimulation of alpha-amylase release by adrenergic agonists. Also consistent with this idea was the observation that stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation by isoproterenol was much more sensitive to inhibition by propranolol than was the stimulation of alpha-amylase release by isoproterenol. Stimulation of alpha-amylase release by phenylephrine was only partially blocked by either alpha- or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, whereas stimulation of adenylate cyclase by phenylephrine was blocked by propranolol and not by phentolaminemphenoxybenzamine and phentolamine potentiated the effects of norepinephrine and isoproterenol on both cyclic AMP accumulation and alpha-amylase release by N-6,O-2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate; These observations may indicate a non-specific action of phenoxybenzamine, and demonstrate the need for caution in interpreting evidence obtained using alpha-adrenergic blocking agents as tools for investigation of alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonism.",

    "input": "Cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphosphate (cyclic AMP) as measured by radioimmunoassay is found in diced rat lung in an amount approximating one picomole per milligram of wet weight lung tissue. Incubation of rat lung with adrenaline, a beta adrenergic agent, produced a rapid increase in cyclic AMP, 100% increase at 15 seconds and 340% at 2 minutes. Isoprenaline was more stimulatory than adrenaline; noradrenaline was less stimulatory, and ephedrine produced a negligible effect. The methylxanthines, caffeine and theophylline, produced an increase in cyclic AMP concentration. Of these, caffeine was more potent, and synergism with adrenaline was demonstrated. The beta adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol, completely inhibited the expected rise in cyclic AMP secondary to adrenaline stimulation. In contrast, the alpha blocker, phentolamine, produced no effect. This animal model offers evidence that adrenergic agents and methylxanthines act to increase cyclic AMP in lung tissue. It is likely that many of the beneficial effects of these drugs in pulmonary patients occur through similar changes and modulation of the cyclic AMP system.",

Small increases were apparent (p less than 0.05, t-test for paired samples) in the hypothalamus. The amounts of cAMP were significantly higher in isolated neural lobes but not in hypothalami of NaCl-treated or lactating as compared to control rats. Presence of cAMP in the neural lobe and activation of adenylate cyclase under stimulated hormone release conditions indicate a possible involvement of cAMP in the process of neurohypophysial hormone secretion.",

    "input": "We determined the effect of alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation on cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) concentrations in isolated myocytes derived from adult rat hearts and in isolated perfused rat hearts. Activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors with either phenylephrine (10(-8) M to 10(-6) M) or epinephrine (10(-8) M to 10(-6) M) plus propranolol (10(-6) M) resulted in a reduction in cyclic AMP levels in isolated myocytes. The action of phenylephrine was antagonized by phentolamine (10(-6) M). Phenylephrine (10(-5)M attenuated cyclic AMP generation in response to isoproterenol (10(-8) M and 10(-5) M). However, this effect of phenylephrine was not antagonized by phentolamine. Elevation of cyclic AMP concentrations produced by glucagon and by theophylline in isolated myocytes was attenuated by phenylephrine and by epinephrine plus propranolol and the attenuation was antagonized by phentolamine. In isolated perfused rat hearts epinephrine (10(-6) M), when given with propranolol, diminished the rate of development of tension and also reduced tissue levels of cyclic AMP. Epinephrine alone, as well as isoproterenol, increased contractility and myocardial cyclic AMP concentrations as expected. These results indicate that catecholamines may increase or decrease cyclic AMP levels in rat myocardium, depending on the intensity of stimulation of receptor types. Increases are mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors, whereas decreases appear to by mediated by alpha-adrenergic receptors.",

    "input": "1. The effect of catecholamines on cyclic adenosine 3'5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) production in isolated rat superior cervical ganglia has been measured under experimental conditions in which they also produce ganglion hyperpolarization.2. (+/-)Isoprenaline (1 muM) increased cyclic AMP levels by 8-100 times after 15 min incubation at 25 degrees C. Half-maximal stimulation occurred at about 0.03 muM. This was due to stimulation of beta-receptors, since it was prevented by 1 muM-propranolol but not by 1 muM-phentolamine.3. The alpha-agonists phenylephrine (100 muM), dopamine (100 muM) and clonidine (1 muM) did not produce a detectable increase in ganglionic cyclic AMP. Dopamine (100 muM) was also ineffective at 37 degrees C in the presence of 10 mM-theophylline.4. Exogenous cyclic AMP (0.01-1 mM) hyperpolarized the ganglion. This effect was replicated by other adenosine compounds, most effectively by adenosine and by adenosine 5'-monophosphate, and was antagonized by theophylline. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP was weaker than cyclic AMP.5. Neither theophylline nor the non-xanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, enhanced the hyperpolarizing actions of noradrenaline or dopamine.6. Since catecholamine-induced hyperpolarization of the isolated rat ganglion is induced via alpha-receptors, whereas cyclic AMP-production is induced via beta-receptors, it is concluded that cyclic AMP is unlikely to mediate the hyperpolarization. The effect of exogenous cyclic AMP may be due to an action on external adenosine-receptors.",

Adrenaline (0.5-2.0 mg/kg) elevated the gastric mucosal cAMP and cGMP levels up to 100% in a dose-dependent manner. Blockade of the beta-adrenoceptors with 4 mg/kg propranolol suppressed the adrenaline effect on the cAMP level and increased the effect on the cGMP concentration up to 500%. The opposite effect was found under alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. Phenoxybenzamine, 4 mg/kg, prevented the adrenaline effect on the cGMP level and increased the effect on the cAMP concentration up to 300%. Predominant stimulation of the beta-adrenoceptors by isoproterenol or of the alpha-adrenoceptors by phenylephrine caused smaller changes in the cyclic nucleotide concentration than did adrenaline. Their effect was more pronounced when the non-stimulated receptor was blocked. The data indicate that the rat gastric mucosa contains alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. The effect of adrenaline on the gastric mucosal cAMP level is mediated by beta-adrenoceptors and that on the cGMP level by alpha-adrenoceptors.",

At epinephrine concentrations of 1 micron or less, acetylcholine antagonized all these beta-adrenergic effects and also increased cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) levels. When used alone, acetylcholine produced a rapid elevation of cGMP and markedly diminished contractile force but did not significantly lower basal cAMP levels or cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. The data suggest that changes in cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity can explain the antagonism of epinephrine-induced activation of phosphorylase by acetylcholine, but cannot completely account for the inhibitory effect of the cholinergic agent on contractile force.",

    "input": "The cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) content of isolated unstimulated mast cells and the changes induced by a variety of pharmacologic, metabolic, and physical stimuli were studied. A modified bovine serum albumin density gradient purification method consistently provided mast cell preparations which were 95% or more pure, without apparent damage, and a 73% recovery of the mast cells applied to the gradients. The measured cAMP in unstimulated mast cells was high, a mean of 16 picomoles per million cells. Moderate agitation or contact with glass increased cAMP content about 2-fold. When calcium was omitted from the medium mast cell cAMP was markedly elevated; incremental increases in added calcium ion concentration from 1 muM to 1 mM caused a linear decrease in cAMP content. Theophylline (3 to 20 mM) caused a dose-related increase in mast cell cAMP content, approximately 2-fold at 20 mM theophylline. Epinephrine (0.01 to 1 mM) caused a modest, dose-related increase in cAMP. In the presence of theophylline, epinephrine increased cAMP levels equal to or greater than the sum of the effects of the agents used individually. The increase in cAMP induced by epinephrine was completely inhibited by 100 muM propranolol and partially inhibited by 10 muM propranolol, thus suggesting that a beta adrenergic receptor is involved. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and histamine (in the presence of theophylline) also raised cAMP. Carbamylcholine (1 nM) lowered cAMP 38%; Atropine (0.1 mM) inhibited the decrease in cAMP induced by 1 nM carbamylcholine by 83% indicating that a muscarinic receptor is involved. In these homogeneous single cell suspensions, therefore, cholinergic and beta adrenergic agents have opposing effects on cAMP levels. Diazoxide (10 muM) and adenine (1 muM) caused 37 and 32% decreases in cAMP, respectively. The availability of highly purified mast cells and the identification of agents which either decrease or increase cAMP content allows a direct examination of the role of cAMP in histamine release.",

    "input": "We have performed 40 keratoplasties in 35 eyes presenting with corneal wounds. These injuries follow accidents of which the most frequent are:--metallic foreign bodies;--windscreen. The following results have been obtained after these grafts;--49 p. 100 success;--51 p. 100 failure. In fact 51 p. 100 of the eyes did not benefit from a satisfactory functional result despite the fact that the graft remained clear in 63 p. 100. Our failures are due to two principle complications: cataract and its subsequent surgical management in 28 out of 35 cases, and detachment of the retina in 3 out of 35 cases. The remaining failures are related to the usual complications of other keratoplasties. These keratoplasties are special since a contussion of the posterior pole is often associated with the corneal wound. The indications for these grafts cannot wait until an accurate assessment of the state of the posterior segment is possible, and this is why these grafts are special and why there should be reservations on the prediction of the final visual result. Keratoplasty however remains the only hope for visual recovery and in children the only means of preventing the development of definite amblyopia. Nevertheless in children the prognosis remains the most pessmistic (4 failures out of 5 cases in children under 10).",

Therefore, the percentage of eyes that underwent keratoplasty and had a clear graft despite not achieving a satisfactory functional result is 63% - 51% = 12%.

    "input": "The main findings of the present study are: (a) highly reactive cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) against syngeneic and allogeneic murine leukemia cells were generated in vitro in macro 'one-way' mixed leukocyte-tumor cultures (MLTC). Cultures set up in large tissue culture flasks contained up to 400 X 10(6) normal spleen cells (responder cells) and 20--40 X (10(6) mitomycin C-treated leukemia cells (stimulator cells). Successful sensitization in macrocultures was greatly dependent upon the responder cell density and the responder/stimulator cell ratio. Cytotoxic activity, as measured by the 51Cr-release assay, peaked on day 5--7. (b) Sensitized 'memory' lymphocytes produced in primary MLTC could be restimulated with the original tumor cells to give a more rapid and stronger secondary cytotoxic response. (c) lymphocytes sensitized to allogeneic leukemia cells reacted equally well with sensitizing leukemia cells and with the corresponding normal lymphoid target cells, whereas lymphocytes sensitized to syngeneic leukemia cells did not react with the homologous normal lymphocytes. (d) Cryopreserved normal splenocytes and leukemia cells were as efficient as fresh cells in generating allogeneic and syngeneic CTL. (e) Using a Winn-type tumor neutralization assay, it was shown that both allogeneic and syngeneic splenocytes sensitized in vitro to EL4 leukemia (of C57BL/6 mice) and to YAC leukemia (of A mice) were capable of preventing tumor growth in the syngeneic host, whereas cultured normal splenocytes frequently showed a tumor-enhancing effect. Long-term survivors, remaining after inoculation of leukemia cells and sensitized lymphocytes, also became resistant to a tumor challenge that was up to 10,000 greater than the minimum lethal dose.",

Although in the majority of these studies, a direct cytotoxic response to the TNP-modified autologous stimulators was not achieved, in all experiments the addition of either allogeneic cells or soluble antigen triggered the generation of killer cells which destroy TNP-modified, but not unaltered, autologous targets. Fractionation of responder lymphocyte populations demonstrated that the cytotoxic activity was mediated by T cells. Killer cell specificity was tested by assaying for cytotoxicity to a variety of targets, and by blocking the cytolysis of TNP-altered autologous targets with various populations of nonradiolabeled cells. Results indicated that these CTL were cytotoxic for TNP-modified autologous cells but not unaltered autologous or TNP-modified allogeneic targets. The capacity of soluble antigen and alloantigens to facilitate the in vitro generation of altered-self reactive human CTL is not an isolated phenomenon. This \"helper\" effect has now been observed for the cytotoxic response to chemically modified autologous cells and MHC identical human leukemic blasts. It is possible that in vivo, similar responses to nonspecific antigenic stimuli may play a role in the maintenance of immune surveillance.",

    "input": "Two non-overlapping populations of alloimmune cytotoxic T cells with specificity for tumor-associated antigens (TAA) and for histocompatibility antigens (H-2) were characterized by two independent methods. The heterogeneity of cytotoxic cells was demonstrated in spleen cells derived from BALB/c (H-2d) mice sensitized to EL-4 (H-2b) tumor and from C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice sensitized to G-35 (H-2d) tumor cells. Adsorption of immune lymphocytes on monolayers prepared with cells bearing the sensitizing H-2 antigens abrogated the in vitro cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) directed against 51Cr-labeled normal target cells (spleen cells or ConA-activated spleen blasts), whereas significant cytolytic activity to the corresponding 51Cr-tumor cells was still retained. Likewise, in competitive inhibition assays, CMC to 51 Cr-tumor target cells was only partially inhibited by unlabeled normal cells, whereas CMC to 51Cr-normal target cells was completely abrogated. These results suggested that alloimmune cytotoxic lymphocytes are heterogeneous and can be subdivided into two independent populations of restricted specificity. Several experiments suggested that the effector cell population directed against TAA can no longer elicit a graft-vs-host (GVH) reaction in vivo. This was demonstrated by adoptive transfer into lethally-irradiated allogeneic recipients of cytotoxic or primed spleen cells fractionated on host target cell monolayers. Furthermore, these results demonstrated that both effector cells and memory cells possess high affinity binding receptors to corresponding H-2 antigens. The potential use of fractionated immune lymphocytes sensitized to tumor allografts in adoptive immunotherapy is discussed.",

    "input": "The requirements for activation of cytotoxic function in mouse T lymphocytes were investigated. Initial generation of cytotoxicity in normal lymphocytes was equal in magnitude with either Con A or specific alloantigen, and in either case required DNA synthesis. Cytotoxic function in MLC-primed cells could also be regenerated by Con A, the magnitude and target specificity of the cytotoxicity thus generated being indistinguishable from that recalled by specific alloantigen. Cytotoxicity could also be regenerated by third party-stimulating cells; however, the cytotoxicity evoked by third party cells was always specific only for target cells of the original stimulating cell H-2 genotype. The data presented suggest that there are a number of ways to activate cytotoxicity in effector T cells, and are most consistent with a model for T cell triggering that minimizes a strict informational function of antigen-receptor interactions.",
    "output": "The initial generation of cytotoxicity in normal lymphocytes requires DNA synthesis, which can be triggered by either Concanavalin A (Con A) or specific alloantigen. Additionally, cytotoxicity can be regenerated by Con A or third-party stimulating cells, but the cytotoxicity evoked by third-party cells is always specific to the target cells of the original stimulating cell's H-2 genotype.

The degree of lysis of target cells was dependent on the amount of hapten coupled to stimulator and target cells. Spleen cells from normal mice responded to high-hapten density cells but not to low-hapten density cells. However, spleen cells from immunized CBA mice could be stimulated in vitro by low-hapten density cells to generate effector cells able to lyse low-hapten density cells. In vitro primed responder cells could be restimulated in the presence of the original hapten-coupled stimulator cells or in the presence of supernatant from concanavalin A-stimulated mouse or rat spleen cells. Large number of hapten-specific and H-2-restricted CTL could be generated by repeated exposure to fresh supernatant.",

    "instruction": "What type of antigens can cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize and respond to, according to the proposed idea in the context?",
    "input": "Many recent studies have demonstrated that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CL) activated to various antigens other than those of the H-2 complex, will lyse target cells only when H-2 compatibility exists between the CL and target cell. From these observations, it has been inferred that T lymphocytes might only be capable of responding to H-2 antigen or antigens that become associated with H-2 region gene products. Our results suggest that this is not the case, and that in some situations, cytotoxic T lymphocytes can specifically lyse target cells of different H-2 types. Two in vitro systems are described where primary induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to oncofetal and plasmacytoma antigens results in CL capable of lysing suitable targets bearing these antigens, of either syngeneic or allogeneic derivation. Thus it is proposed that although interaction antigens involving H-2 components may preferentially activate T lymphocytes, this does not imply a restriction on the recognition potential of T lymphocytes.",

    "input": "Cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) to trinitrophenyl (TNP)-modified autologous splenic lymphocytes has been recently reported in the mouse (1). Both the sensitization and effector phases of this phenomenon were shown to be T-cell mediated. Effector cell specificity studies indicated that modification of the target cells is a necessary but insufficient requirement for cytolysis, and suggested that altered cell surface components controlled by genes mapping in the mouse major histocompatibility H-2 complex (MHC) are important in the specificity of the cytotoxic reaction (1). In allogeneic models the generation of cytotoxic effector cells has been shown to be preceded or accompanied by immunogen- induced proliferation of responding lymphocytes, i.e. a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) (2-5), although the generation of effectors may not necessarily always be the consequence of extensive cell proliferation (5). If the induction of cytotoxic effector lymphocytes by modified syngeneic spleen cells is characteristic of sensitization with cellular alloantigens, one would expect to find that sensitization with TNP-modified autologous cells would also induce thymidine incorporation by the responding cells in the culture. The present report demonstrates that both stimulation of thymidine incorporation and generation of cytotoxic effector cells are part of the in vitro response to TNP-modified autologous lymphocytes. However, the MLR to TNP- modified autologous cells consistently appeared to be less pronounced when compared with an allogeneic MLR, whereas the cytotoxic activity of the effector cells generated by sensitization against TNP-modified autologous cells was frequently as high as that detected against H-2 alloantigens. These two components of reactivity to \"modified self\" are verified in several C57BL/10 congenic and B10.A recombinant mouse strains.",

    "input": "Autologous mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) reactions were studied utilizing autologous purified B cells and autologous established B lymphoid cell lines as stimulating cells. Similar results were obtained although somewhat greater stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation was found with the autologous lymphoid cell lines. Cytotoxic T cells were not generated against the stimulating cells in either case when peripheral blood cells were used as targets. A low cytotoxicity was detected when lymphoid cell lines were used both as stimulators and target cells. However this was nonspecific and was always greater for heterologous lines than for the stimulator line. Third-party cell experiments demonstrated that the autologous reaction could serve as a proliferative stimulus for specific cytotoxic lymphocyte generation. Heat-treated allogeneic lymphocytes that alone do not stimulate proliferation ro cytotoxic T-cell generation in MLC reactions when added to the autologous system produced specific cytotoxic cells. The separation of the proliferative phase from the cytotoxic cell generation was especially striking in these experiments. Possible uses of this system for the generation of specific cytotoxic cells to other nonstimulatory cells are discussed.",

    "input": "Concepts of the incidence, significance and prognosis of almost all cardiac arrhythmias during acute myocardial infarction have changed greatly in the last 15 years. In some cities facilities are available to reach patients in the very earliest phases of ischaemia or infarction. As previously suspected but now confirmed, ventricular fibrillation occurs commonly at this time and depending on whether ischaemia or infarction is the basis of its occurrence, has a variable long-term prognosis. In the coronary care unit ventricular arrhythmias are more frequent than was originally believed and current research suggests that they have little if any predictive value in defining individuals who would develop ventricular fibrillation. Such events, however, appear related to the severity of myocardial or coronary artery disease. Similarly, asystole and heart block in acute myocardial infarction are important causes of mortality through their association with severe underlying disease. Other cardiac arrhythmias are not infrequent in acute myocardial infarction. They may carry an immediate prognostic implication for the patient but rarely have long-term implications. Autonomic nervous system disturbances may underlie many arrhythmias occurring particularly in the earliest phases of infarction.",

    "instruction": "What is the time frame by which patients with an uncomplicated myocardial infarction may be safely discharged from the hospital?",
    "input": "1. Coronary insufficiency is a pathophysiologic state that can initiate lethal cardiac arrhythmias in the absence of myocardial necrosis. Patients with suspected coronary insufficiency should be monitored until they are stabilized and a diagnosis is confirmed. 2. Early and adequate intravenous antiarrhythmic prophylaxis with lidocaine to raise the fibrillation threshold in the setting of coronary insufficiency can prevent primary ventricular fibrillation. Classic \"warning arrhythmias\" are not predictive of ventricular fibrillation. Their persistence during adequate antifibrillatory prophylaxis does not indicate therapeutic failure. 3. The isoenzyme of creatine phosphokinase, CPK-MB, is an extremely sensitive and specific indicator of myocardial necrosis if measured serially during the 24 hours following the onset of symptoms suggesting coronary insufficiency. It may prove most useful in eliminating the false positive diagnosis of myocardial infarction in  difficult clinical cases. 4. The management of heart failure in myocardial infarction requires an understanding of the relationship between ventricular preload and the cardiac output. The treatment of clinical manifestations of an elevated ventricular preload in asymptomatic patients is not justified and may be detrimental. In symptomatic patients, however, judicious manipulation of ventricular preload should be the first therapeutic consideration, and an optimal filling pressure should be achieved and maintained when other determinants of the cardiac output are manipulated. 5. Indications for the prophylactic insertion of a temporary transvenous pacing electrode for heart block associated with myocardial infarction must be individualized. Most authorities agree that prophylactic pacing may be justified in patients with evidence of new infranodal block involving two of the three fascicles. Patients with bifascicular block who progress to complete heart block transiently may benefit from permanent transvenous pacemaker insertion before discharge. 6. Hospitalized patients with persistent pain of suspected cardiac origin but without evidence of myocardial infarction can be studied safely with coronary angiography. A small percentage will be normal or have diffuse disease that is inoperable. Of those with operable disease, short-term mortality appears to be similar for medical and surgical therapy. 7. Patients with an uncomplicated myocardial infarction may be safely discharged from thehospital by day 7-10. 8. Experimental evidence indicates that modification of infarct size is possible. Application of these concepts to human subjects presently is limited by the absence of a proved method of measuring infarct size in vivo in humans.",

This time frame is based on the understanding that they have recovered from the initial event and are no longer at immediate risk.

The interval between acute infarction and coronary arteriography was usually less than 6 months. The average age of the patients was 36.9 years, affecting more women than in classical coronary artery disease. The acute infarction was nearly always the first symptom. Cigarette consumption and hormonal factors is women were coronary risks factors of note. Ventricular sequellae were frequent, cardiac failure exceptional, exercise testing nearly always negative and occupational rehabilitation usually normal. It would seem that this affection is less serious than classical myocardial infarction due to atheroma probably because the non-infarcted myocardium is healthy, but the true prognosis of this type of coronary accident will only be revealed by long term studies. In the meantime the most useful investigations and the management of these patients are discussed.",

    "input": "A very sensitive enzymeimmunoassay for testosterone was developed using testosterone-penicillinase conjugate and an antibody to testosterone-3-(O-carboxymethyl)oxime-bovine serum albumin. The specificity of the assay was demonstrated by the fact that estradiol-17 beta, estrone, estriol, progesterone, 17 alpha-hydroxy-progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, cortisol and cortisone were ineffective in crossreacting with testosterone while dihydrotestosterone was 8 times less crossreactive as compared to testosterone. The minimum detectable amount of testosterone was 10-15 pg per assay tube. Intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation for samples containing 0.3-6ng/ml of testosterone were 6-8% and 8-10%, respectively. A high degree of correlation (r = 0.97) was observed between serum testosterone values obtained by enzymeimmunoassay and radioimmunoassay. The levels of testosterone in the sera of normal men and women and those in hypogonadal males following stimulation with human chorionic gonadotropin determined by this enzymeimmunoassay appear similar to those reported by other investigators.",

Maternal venous blood was drawn before and at regular intervals for 240 minutes after DHEA-injection. Thereafter, legal abortion was performed by intraamniotic instillation of prostaglandine. The conjugated steroids were hydrolyzed enzymatically and the total steroids were isolated and identified. The following labelled metabolites were determined quantitatively: Estriol (e3, estradiol-17beta (E2-17beta), estrone(E1), 16alpha-hydroxy-estrone, (16alpha-OH-DHEA), ALPHA4-androstenedione (AD) and testosterone (T). The maximal increase of all estrogen fractions in matermal plasma occurred 120-180min after intraamniotic injection of the precursor.

    "input": "Previous studies from this laboratory have included reports on the serum concentrations of the following steroids in premenopausal and postmenopausal women: pregnenolone, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, cortisol, corticosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estone, and estradiol 17-beta. In general the steroid levels were lower in postmenopausal subjects, and this difference was significant at P smaller than 0.05 for 8 of the steroids. The significantly decreased peripheral level of steroids in the postmenopausal state can be explained by decreases either in ovarian secretion of steroids or in ovarian stimulation of the adrenal cortex. Since the contribution of the adrenal cortex to the peripheral levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) is greater than 95% in premenopausal women, a plausible explanation for the marked drop observed in peripheral DHEA-S levels after menopause is that the ovary influences the steroidogenic activity of the adrenal cortex. In such cases a decrease in the stimulation of the adrenal cortex by some ovarian steroids would be expected. Estrogen therapy in 10 postmenopausal women resulted in significant increases in the serum levels of 3 of the steroids compared to those in untreated subjects, confirming the postulate that ovarian estrogens stimulate the secretion of adrenal androgens.",
    "output": "The context suggests that the contribution of the adrenal cortex to the peripheral levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) in premenopausal women is greater than 95%. This implies that the majority of DHEA-S in premenopausal women comes from the adrenal cortex."

Therefore, a relatively simple procedure for separating steroids was combined with highly specific assay methods so that eight androgens could be measured with high accuracy, precision and sensitivity. Semi-automated separations on Sephadex LH-20 columns used heptane:methylene chloride:ethanol:water (50:50:1:0.12) and a flow rate of 17.0 min/ml. The six peaks eluted contained androstenedine; androsterone, epiandrosterone and dihydrotestosterone; testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone; 3alpha-androstanediol; 3beta-androstanediol; and androstenediol. Androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenediol were quantified using specific antisera (sensitivity less than or equal to 75 pg). Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone were measured by competitive protein-binding assays using rabbit TeBG (sensitivity less than or equal to 150 pg). 3alpha- and 3beta-androstanediol were similarly assayed using human TeBG (sensitivity approximately 150 pg). Androsterone was reduced with NaBH4 and the resulting 3alpha-androstanediol was assayed using human TeBG (sensitivity approximately 200 pg).

The steroids, except testosterone, were detectable in all ovaries studied. Dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione, regarded as preandrogens, were present in an increased amount in almost all patients with polycycstic ovaries. Gas chromatographic evidence was obtained for the presence of testosterone in two of the cases. The delta4/3betaOH ratio reflecting 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity was decreased only in same patients with the Stein-Leventhal syndrome suggesting that the impaired function of this enzyme is not an obligatory feature of polycystic ovaries. Concentration of pregnenolone and progesterone measured in a part of cases varied in a great range although the determination was caried out before luteal phase. Simultaneous determination of hormones in both ovarian tissues revealed an active and an inactive period of the gland in the given time, since a great difference of hormone concentration in bilateral ovarian tissues were observed. A comparison of hormone content in ovaries and the urinary excretion of metabolites showed poor correlation between the two parameters of hormone production.",

Serum concentrations of oestradiol, pregnenolone, progesterone, 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, testosterone, 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone and androsterone were determined from a single serum sample (1.6 ml). Oestradiol was determined by an automated non-chromatographic radioimmunoassay, while other steroids were determined by radioimmunoassays, after solvent extraction and chromatographic purification on Lipidex-5000TM microcolumns. When patient groups were compared with the 25 normal males between 50 and 80 years of age, several conclusions could be drawn. Serum concentrations of 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (P less than 0.01) and 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (P less than 0.001) were both significantly higher in the BPH patients when compared with the normal males. This trend was also apparent in the serum concentrations of progesterone and testosterone in the older BPH patients. Although the mean concentrations of 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone and 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone were slightly higher in carcinoma patients than normal males, these differences were not statistically significant. No differences were seen in the concentrations of pregnenolone, androstenedione, androsterone and oestradiol between normal subjects and patients with BPH or prostatic Ca.",

In normal adult prostates (n = 18) the concentrations of steroids (mean +/- S.E.M. ng/g wet tissue) were: testosterone, 0.25 +/- 0.04; androstenedione, 0.13 +/- 0.03; 5alpha-androstane-3,17-dione (5alpha-androstanedione), 1.31 +/- 0.30; 17beta-hydroxy-5alpha-androstan-3-one (5alpha-dihydrotestosterone, DHT), 1.22 +/- 0.14; 5alpha-androstane-3alpha, 17 beta-diol (3alpha-androstanediol), 4.32 +/- 0.49; androsterone, 4.15 +/- 1.07; progestrone, 0.39 +/- 0.07; 17alpha-hydroxyprogestrone, 0.42 +/- 0.06. Concentrations of of steroids tissues from outer-gland regions were within the ranges found in the periurethral regions. In the prostates of newborn boys, the concentrations of all steroids were high, including progesterone and 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone. Apart from 3alpha-androstanediol, the levels of which tend to increase after this age, the concentrations of all steroids were lower in the infant and pubertal prostates, but most were re-established to a variable extend in the adult tissues. This was particularly evident with respect to 5alpha-androstanedione and androsterone, and it is suggested that these two androgens may have a functional role in the mature prostate. The concentrations of testosterone, androstenedione, 5alpha-androstanedione, progesterone and 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone in tissue taken from ten patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) were similar to those in normal adult adult tissue. The concentration of DHT was markedly raised (5.33 +/- 0.46 ng/g) and the level of 3alpha-androstanediol and androsterone were reduced (1.40 +/- 0.12 ng/g respectively) in adenomatous compared with normal tissue. The concentrations of various androgens displayed remarkable interelationships which characterize normal and BPH tissues. The concentrations of testosterone, androstenedione, DHT and 3alpha-androstanediol were particularly high in the untreated prostatic carcinomatous tissue sample investigated, whereas the concentrations of 5alpha-androstanedione and androsterone were very low. After oestrogen treatment, testosterone and androstenedione virtually disappeared, while reduced but significant concentrations of their metabolites remained in similar proportions to those observed in the untreated carcinomatous tissue. Under the conditions of therapy, oestrogens are suggested to influence the uptake of androgens.",

    "input": "Intravenous urography with total body opacification, and tomography as required, often give the most information toward evaluating abdominal masses in children. Ultrasonography is a noninvasive procedure which defines normal structures and differentiates cystic and solid tumors. The combination of these studies gives sufficient information about renal tumors to plan for possible surgery. Arteriography is not necessary for the diagnosis of Wilms' tumor, nor its surgical or medical management. Pseudotumor of the kidney is due to focal cortical hyperplasia. It can be diagnosed by nephrotomography, renal arteriography or renal scanning. The latter method is most accurate and has the lowest morbidity. Aortography is advisable in the evaluation of a patient with pheochromocytoma in an attempt to locate multiple tumors. Determining the extent of abdominal neuroblastoma by angiography and lymphangiography does not appear to influence the mode of therapy, not the survival rate; therefore, invasive diagnostic procedures do not appear to be indicated in neuroblastoma. Angiography is necessary in the evaluation of liver cancer. If one lobe is determined to be free of disease, lobectomy is a possible cure.

    "input": "Echography permits information on the shape of the kidneys and ureteral system without reference to their function, and on the perirenal tissue. This is illustrated by a typical example. Echography also provides rapid orientation in the recognition of collections of fluid in the preformed body cavities, which can rapidly bring the affected patient into a life-threatening condition, particularly in the shape of a pericardial effusion. For this reason the inclusion of echography in the investigation program in the care of patients with chronic renal insufficiency is recommended.",
    "output": "The condition that can particularly bring a patient into a life-threatening condition in the shape of a collection of fluid, as mentioned in the context, is a pericardial effusion. This is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart, which can compress the heart and interfere with its normal function. If left untreated, it can lead to cardiac tamponade, a medical emergency that can be life-threatening."

In one third of cases there was some discrepancy relating to a significant diagnostic finding (malignant process, peptic ulcer, polyp, stenosis or deformity, abnormal folds, diverticula or normal findings). In analysing false negative and false positive radiological diagnoses, the patients were divided into two groups (with or without a double contrast technique). Conventional radiography proved ten to 38% less reliable than the double contrast technique for a variety of reasons. In view of the high diagnostic accuracy of modern radiological investigations of the stomach and duodenum, endoscopy and biopsy are recommended as complementary procedures. In addition to the high degree of accuracy of radiological methods for various pathological processes, endoscopy places considerable demands during investigation of the upper intestinal tract. At present radiology is used 19 times as frequently as endoscopy, suggesting that there might have to be a tenfold increase in the capacity of pathological departments if endoscopy is used more frequently.",

    "input": "Angiography is a decisive technique of diagnosis of space-occupying processes in the liver. In contrast to laboratory-techniques, scintigraphy and ultrasound which ought to precede it, angiography permits a diagnosis of the type of lesion and is a guide to the chances of surgery on the basis of vascular topography. Angiographic findings in primary and secondary benign and malignant tumors of the liver, of cysts, abscesses and trauma are described and demonstrated on cases. The various forms of portal hypertension are a further field for angiographic diagnosis, explained on examples. The techniques of showing the hepatic arteries, the portal circulation and hepatic veins including direct portography are described and their usefulness for the various diseases discussed. The still little tested therapeutic use of liver angiography in hemorrhage and tumors is mentioned.",
    "output": "Before angiography for the diagnosis of space-occupying processes in the liver, scintigraphy and ultrasound are typically used as initial diagnostic techniques. These methods provide a preliminary assessment of the liver and help identify the presence and location of a space-occupying lesion. Once a lesion is detected, angiography can be employed to determine the type of lesion, guide surgical intervention based on vascular topography, and provide more detailed information about the lesion's characteristics."

    "input": "Purified cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase of bovine cardiac muscles catalyzes the incorporation of 2 mol of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP to seryl residues in its cAMP-binding protein. The reaction appears to be catalyzed by the protein kinase itself rather than by a protein kinase kinase and is enhanced by cAMP and by the addition of polyarginine. Phosphorylation of the purified enzyme facilitates its dissociation by cAMP (Erlichman, J., Rosenfeld, R., and Rosen, O.M. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 5000-5003) but does not affect cAMP binding. At equilibrium, 2 mol of cAMP are bound to both the phospho- and dephospho-enzymes. Phosphorylation of protein kinase is reversible. Upon addition of ADP and Mg2+, phosphate is transferred from the protein to ADP, and ATP is formed. The reverse reaction is optimal at pH 5.5 unlike the forward reaction which has a broad, more alkaline pH activity optimum. It is activated by polyarginine and dependent upon the addition of cAMP to a much greater degree than the forward reaction. The data suggest that the catalytic subunit of protein kinase catalyzes the forward and reverse reactions but do not exclude the possibility that the holoenzyme may also be active. Autophosphorylation by protein kinase and dephosphorylation by phosphrprotein phosphatases of by reverals of the autophosphorylation reaction may regulate the sensitivity of certain protein kinases to activation by cAMP in vivo.",

    "input": "Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase has been well established to be composed of catalytic and regulatory subunits, and cyclic AMP acts to dissociate these subunits to exhibit full enzymatic activity. In contrast, cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase does not possess such a subunit structure and is activated by cyclic GMP simply in an allosteric manner. In addition to cyclic AMP-dependent and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases, another species of multifunctional protein kinase has been found in many mammalian tissues. This protein kinase is entirely independent of cyclic nucleotides and activated by lower concentrations of Ca2+ in the presence of a membrane-associated factor. This factor has been identified as phospholipids; in fact, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine are active in this role, whereas lecithin and sphingomyelin are unable to activate the enzyme. Thus, the three species of protein kinases mentioned above are activated in different manners. Nevertheless, these enzymes show very similar substrate specificities and phosphorylate the same specific seryl residues of histone fractions. In addition, all enzymes have abilities to activate and inactivate muscle phosphorylase kinase and glycogen synthetase, respectively, although the relative rates of reactions towards various substrates are markedly different. The Ca2+-dependent protein kinase seems to be associated with membranous components, whereas cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase appears to be related to certain subcellular organella such as nucleus. Suggestive evidence is available implying that the cyclic AMP-, cyclic GMP- and Ca2+-activated three sets of protein kinase systems may play each specific physiological roles presumably owing to their own subcellular compartments.",

This system is used as a model to understand the function of these activities in a rapidly proliferating cell. Adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations are 5-fold higher in the lymphosarcoma cells than in thymocytes. In both the thymocytes and malignant tissue, cAMP concentrations are increased by physiological concentrations of epinephrine and prostaglandin. The guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cGMP) level in the lymphosarcoma is 0.1 pmole/10(6) cells and is not modified by acetylcholine, prostaglandin F2alpha, or concanavalin A. Four protein phosphotransferase activities have been identified in the lymphosarcoma. These are the cAMP-dependent protein kinase type I and II isozymes and a \"histone kinase\" and a \"phosvitin kinase\"; neither of the latter two is regulated by cyclic nucleotides. Characterization of these enzymes was based on fractionation by DE 52 chromatography, substrate specificity, interaction with the protein inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinases, and sucrose gradient sedimentation rates. Both the cAMP-dependent protein phosphotransferase activity and the phosvitin phosphotransferase activity are 2-to 4-fold elevated in the lymphosarcoma cells in comparison to thymocytes. cAMP binding is associated with both the type I and II isozymes and with a fraction tentatively designated as the regulatory subunit of these enzymes. cGMP also binds to this later fraction and to the partially purified fraction containing the type IcAMP-dependent enzyme. The histone phosphotransferase activity of this fraction is also stimulated by cGMP, but studies of the number of binding sites and of absorption to cAMP and cGMP affinity resins indicated that this fraction contains more than one species of cyclic nucleotide-binding protein.",

The 0.2 M NaCl fraction from DEAE-Sephadex showed a small 2.9-S peak of basal enzyme activity, and a large 6.5-S peak of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity; fractions eluted from DEAE-Sephadex with 0.3-0.5 M NaCl contained a major 3.8-S peak of cyclic AMP-dependent enzyme activity. Activation of protein kinase in cell extracts by cyclic AMP, and in intact interstitial cells by trophic hormone, caused a major shift of enzyme activity to the 2.9-S cyclic AMP-dependent form which was eluted from DEAE-Sephadex by 0.2 M NaCl. These results are consistent with the presence of two distinct protein kinase holoenzymes, with a common 2.9-S catalytic subunit. During hormonal activation of protein kinase in dispersed interstitial cells by 10-10 M human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), conversion to the 2.9-S catalytic subunit was observed between 2 and 30 min of incubation. Protein kinase activity was correlated with cyclic AMP production, and full enzyme activation occurred at the time of maximum intracellular cyclic AMP concentration. The presence of two forms of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in the Leydig cell provides a potential mechanism whereby progressive occupancy of gonadotropin receptors could evoke a series of discrete target cell responses.",

Low substrate concentration (0.4 muM) was used. About 60% of the cyclic-AMP and 80% of the cyclic-GMP hydrolytic activities in the homogenate were obtained in the soluble fraction (105 000 X g supernatant). The thyroid gland contains two forms of cyclic-AMP phosphodiesterase, one with a Km of 1.3-10(-5) M and the second with a Km of 2-10(-6) M. Cyclic-AMP and cyclic-GMP phosphodiesterase were purified by gel filtration on a Sepharose-6B column. Cyclic-AMP phosphodiesterase activities were found in a broad area corresponding to molecular weights ranging from approx. 200 000 to 250 000 and cyclic-GMP phosphodiesterase activity was found in a single area corresponding to a molecular weight of 260 000. Cyclis-AMP phosphodiesterase activities were stimulated by the protein activator which was found in human thyroid and this stimulation was dependent on Ca2+. Stimulation of cyclic-AMP phosphodiesterase by the activator was not significant even in the presence of enough Ca2+. The effect of D,L-triiodothyronine, D,L-thyroxine, L-diiodotyrosine, L-monoiodotyrosine, L-thyronine, L-diiodothyronine, thyrotropin, hydrocortisone, adrenocorticotropin, cyclic-AMP and cyclic-GMP on the phosphodiesterase activities was studied. Cyclic-AMP, cyclic-GMP, D,L-triiosothyronine, D,L-thyroxine, adrenocorticotropin and hydrocortisone where found to inhibit the phophodiesterase. Triiodothyronine and thyroxine inhibited cyclic-AMP phosphodiesterase more effectively than cyclic-GMP phosphodiesterase. Thyroxine was a more potent inhibitor than triiodothyronine. The concentration of cyclic AMP producing a 50% inhibition of cyclic-GMP phosphodiesterase activity was 5-10(-5) M, while the concentration of cyclic GMP producing a 50% inhibition of cyclic-AMP phosphodiesterase was 3-10(-3) M. Both cyclic-AMP and cyclic-GMP phosphodiesterase activities in the homogenate of hyperthyroidism, thyroid carcinoma and adenoma were higher than in normal thyroid tissue, when assayed with a low concentration of the substrate (0.4 muM).

Two of the binding peaks co-chromatographed with the catalytic activities of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases (ATP-protein phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.37) of type I or type II respectively. A third binding protein was eluted between the two kinases, and appeared to be the free regulatory moiety of protein kinase I. Two of the binding proteins for cyclic AMP, sedimenting at 9S in sucrose gradients, could also bind adenosine. They bound cyclic AMP with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K(d)) of about 0.1mum, and showed an increased binding capacity for cyclic AMP after preincubation in the presence of K(+), Mg(2+) and ATP. The two binding proteins differed in their apparent affinities for adenosine. The isolated regulatory moiety of protein kinase I had a very high affinity for cyclic AMP (K(d)<0.1nm). At low ionic strength or in the presence of MgATP, the high-affinity binding of cyclic AMP to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase I was decreased by the catalytic subunit. At high ionic strength and in the absence of MgATP the high-affinity binding to the regulatory subunit was not affected by the presence of catalytic subunit. Under all experimental conditions tested, dissociation of protein kinase I was accompanied by an increased affinity for cyclic AMP. To gain some insight into the mechanism by which cyclic AMP activates protein kinase, the interaction between basic proteins, salt and the cyclic nucleotide in activating the kinase was studied.",
    "output": "The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for the binding of cyclic AMP to the two 9S sedimenting binding proteins, which are associated with cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases of type I or II, is about 0.1mum. This value suggests a relatively strong binding affinity between cyclic AMP and these proteins. However, it's important to note that the regulatory moiety of protein kinase I has a much higher affinity for cyclic AMP (Kd<0.1nm). The binding properties of these proteins can be influenced by factors such as ionic strength, the presence of MgATP, and the interaction with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase I."

    "input": "An adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase II (ATP:protein phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.37) was partially purified from the cytosol fraction of an exponentially growing culture of Tetrahymena pyriformis.  Protein kinase II represented approximately 90% of the cytosolic protein kinase activity.  The enzyme had a high degree of substrate specificity for calf thymus and Tetrahymena histones as compared to casein, protamine and phosvitin.  The enzyme incorporated the terminal phosphate of ATP into serine and threonine residues of all the histone fractions.  The apparent Km of the enzyme for adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) was 1-10-minus 8 M.  Protein kinase II was also activated by other cyclic nucleotides with apparent Km values in the range 2.k-10-minus 6 M.  Ther specific activity of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase of Tetrahymena decreases markedly from initial high values during the transition from the lag to early log phase of growth.  This is followed by a shrp increase in the activity of the enzyme as the log phase of growth progresses.  The specific activity of the enzyme increases rapidly during the heat-induced synchronization of Tetrahymena cells.  The capacity for rapid phosphorylation of multiple classed of organelle-specific phosphoproteins and the level of cyclic AMP were maximal in Tetrahymena during the earliest phase of growth.  These results demonstrate that the cell cycle of Tetrahymena may be coordinated by marked variations in the level of cyclic AMP which in turn regulate the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase.",
    "output": "The context provided does not specify the total cytosolic protein kinase activity in Tetrahymena pyriformis. However, it does state that protein kinase II represented approximately 90% of the cytosolic protein kinase activity.

The concentration of cyclic GMP required to activate half-maximally cyclic dependent protein kinase was 1000- to 100-fold less than that of cyclic AMP with these substrates. The opposite was true with cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase where 1000- to 100-fold less cyclic AMP than cyclic GMP was required for half-maximal enzyme activation. This contrasts with the lower degree of cyclic nucleotide specificity of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase of 25-fold when histone H2b was used as a substrate for phosphorylation. Cyclic IMP resembled cyclic AMP in effectiveness in stimulating cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase but was intermediate between cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP in stimulating cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. The effect of cyclic IMP on cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase was confirmed in studies of autophosphorylation of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase where both cyclic AMP and cyclic IMP enhanced autophosphorylation. The high degree of cyclic nucleotide specificity observed suggests that cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP activate only their specific kinase and that crossover to the opposite kinase is unlikely to occur at reported cellular concentrations of cyclic nucleotides.",
    "output": "The difference in concentration required for half-maximal activation of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (cGMP-PK) and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP-PK) is significant. cGMP-PK requires 1000- to 100-fold less concentration of cyclic GMP for half-maximal activation compared to cAMP-PK. Conversely, cAMP-PK requires 1000- to 100-fold less concentration of cyclic AMP for half-maximal activation compared to cGMP-PK. This suggests that these kinases have a high degree of cyclic nucleotide specificity, meaning they are more likely to be activated by their specific cyclic nucleotide (cGMP for cGMP-PK and cAMP for cAMP-PK) and are unlikely to be activated by the other cyclic nucleotide at reported cellular concentrations."

The chicks were examined chronologically for the distribution of the virus in the body. As a result, minute amounts of the virus were detected from the liver, spleen, pancreas, and muscle at the site of inoculation one day after inoculation and various amounts from almost all the organs 3 days and more after inoculation. The virus titer could nearly reach a maximum 7 to 9 days after inoculation. Above all, such high virus titers as ranging from 10(4.3) to 10(5.8) EID50/0.1 g were demonstrated in the brain, heart, liver, spleen, and pancreas. After that, there was a tendency for virus titer to decrease in most organs and for virus to multiply persistently in the pancreas, brain, and eyeball. Virus titer was maintained at a level of 10(2.3) approximately 10(2.8) EID50/0.1 g in these three organs even 21 days after inoculation. In the group of subcutaneous inoculation, all the chicks manifested clinical signs of infection 5 to 10 days after inoculation. On the other hand, no chicks were involved in clinical infection in the group of oral inoculation. Multiplication of the virus was delayed in the body of these chicks. Small amounts of the virus were detected from the spleen and pancreas 11 days after inoculation.

In the first experiment, 4-day-old chicken embryos were inoculated into the yolk sac with serial dilutions of virus and subsequently hatched. High virus doses killed all embryos, whereas low doses (14 or less plaque-forming units) allowed some embryos to hatch normally although infected. In the second experiment, virus was administered by the nasal, esophageal, and tracheal routes to twenty 15-month-old breeders. Eggs from -6 to 21 days and 58 to 64 days postinoculation were incubated. Three newly hatched chicks from eggs laid on successive days (17, 18, and 19 days postinoculation) and one infertile egg (61 days postinoculation) were found infected. Active infection, as judged by virus isolations from cloacal swabs, was over by the 17th day postinoculation.",

Contact infection by environmental exposure to ALV was 100% effective in newly hatched and 28-day-old chicks. All contact-infected birds responded immunologically after transient viremia. A follow-up of immune birds from these six groups demonstrated that active multiplication of ALV continued despite neutralizing antibody. Infectious virus was shed by oral and cloacal routes, as well as through vertical transmission by hens to their embryos. Up to 10(8) infectious units of virus/g of feces was shed by 12-day-old viremic birds, and to a lesser extent virus was also shed in saliva as measured by oral washing. The cycle of contact transmission was also evaluated by the assessment of the efficacy of four portals of entry, where exposed skin was most effective in permitting infection, followed by oral, nasal, and conjunctival routes.",

    "input": "In chick-embryo fibroblasts infected with the Schmidt-Ruppin strain of Rous sarcoma virus, subgroup A (wild type), or with a thermosensitive mutant of this virus, T5, the rates of mitochondrial DNA synthesis differ in cells that exhibit normal and malignant phenotypes. In wild type virus-infected cells grown at 36 or 41 degrees C, morphological transformation is expressed, the rate of 2-deoxy-D-[3H]glucose uptake is stimulated, and mitochondrial DNA synthesis in vivo is stimulated three- to fivefold over that in uninfected cells. In T5-infected cells these changes occur only at the permissive temperature (36 degrees C); a shift to the nonpermissive temperature (41 degrees C) causes the reversal of these effects, and the specific activity of purified mitochondrial DNA is characteristic of that from uninfected cells. In contrast, the specific activities of nuclear DNA purified from cells maximally transformed under the permissive conditions do not differ between wild type-infected and uninfected with the T5 virus. In parallel experiments with isolated mitochondria, the rate of mtDNA synthesis in vitro is again greater in mitochondria isolated from transformed cells. In addition, mitochondrial DNA synthesis in vitro in mitochondria from nontransformed and virus-transformed cells exhibits differential sensitivity to inhibition by mercaptoethanol. Furthermore, the ntDNAP polymerase activity in mitochondrial extracts prepared from cells with transformed phenotypes is about sevenfold higher than in extracts from cells with nontransformed phenotypes.",
    "output": "In T5-infected cells, a shift to the nonpermissive temperature (41 degrees C) causes a reversal of the stimulated mitochondrial DNA synthesis observed at the permissive temperature (36 degrees C). At the nonpermissive temperature, mitochondrial DNA synthesis in T5-infected cells resembles that in uninfected cells. This suggests that the temperature shift inhibits mitochondrial DNA synthesis in T5-infected cells."

    "input": "Mouse, hamster, and human cells were transformed at the permissive temperature by mutants from simian virus 40 (SV40) complementation group A in order to ascertain the role of the gene A function in transformation. The following parameters of transformation were monitored with the transformed cells under permissive and nonpermissive conditions: morphology; saturation density; colony formation on plastic, on cell monolayers, and in soft agar; uptake of hexose; and the expression of SV40 tumor (T) and surface (S) antigens. Cells transformed by the temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants exhibited the phenotype of transformed cells at the nonrestrictive temperature for all of the parameters studied. However, when grown at the restrictive temperature, they were phenotypically similar to normal, untransformed cells. Growth curves showed that the (ts) A mutant-transformed cells exhibited the growth characteristics of wild-type virus-transformed cells at the permissive temperature and resembled normal cells when placed under restrictive conditions. There were 3-to 51-fold reductions in the levels of saturation density, colony formation, and uptake of hexose when the mutant-transformed cells were the elevated temperature as compared to when they were grown at the permissive temperature. Mutant-transformed cells from the nonpermissive temperature were able to produce transformed foci when shifted down to permissive conditions, indicating that the phenotypically reverted cells were still viable and that the reversion was a reversible event. SV40 T antigen was present in the cells at both temperatures, but S antigen was not detected in cells maintained at the nonpremissive temperature. All of the wild-type virus-transformed cells exhbited a transformed cells exhibited a transformed phenotype when grown under either restrictive or nonrestrictive conditions. Thers results indicate that the SV40 group A mutant-transformed cells are temperature sensitive for the maintenance of growth properties characteristics of transformation. Virus rescued from the mutant-transformed cells by the transfection method was ts, suggesting that the SV40 gene A function, rather than a cellular one, is responsible for the ts behavior of the cells.",

Specifically, there were 3-to 51-fold reductions in these parameters at the restrictive temperature. This suggests that the temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant-transformed cells are sensitive to the restrictive temperature, and their growth properties characteristic of transformation are affected. Additionally, the S antigen was not detected in cells maintained at the nonpermissive temperature, while the T antigen was present at both temperatures. The reversion to a normal phenotype when cells were shifted from the restrictive to the permissive temperature indicates that the reversion is a reversible event."

    "input": "Transformants have been isolated after infection of rat embryo cells at 33 C with either wild-type simian virus 40 or with the temperature-sensitive gene A mutants, tsA7 and tsA28. Examination of properties usually associated with transformation such as growth in 1% serum, growth rate, saturation density, and morphology show that these properties are temperature dependent in the tsA transformants characterized, but are not temperature dependent in the wild-type transformants that have been examined. In the most thoroughly characterized tsA transformants the expression of T antigen also appears to be temperature dependent. These data suggest that an active A function is required for the maintenance of transformation in these cells. In the lytic cycle, the A function is involved in the initiation of DNA synthesis. Thus transformation by simian virus 40 may be the direct consequence of the introduction of the simian virus 40 replicon and the presence of its DNA initiator function, which causes the cell to express a transformed phenotype.",
    "output": "The A function in the lytic cycle of simian virus 40 plays a crucial role in the initiation of DNA synthesis. Additionally, it seems to be essential for the maintenance of the transformed phenotype in infected cells. When the A function is active, it allows the cell to express a transformed phenotype, which includes properties such as growth in low serum, increased growth rate, high saturation density, and altered morphology. This suggests that the A function may be a key player in the transformation process by simian virus 40."

    "input": "Temperature-sensitive (Ts) mutant plasmids isolated from tetracycline resistance R plasmid pSC101 were investigated for their segregation kinetics and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication. The results fit well with the hypothesis that multiple copies of a plasmid are distributed to daughter cells in a random fashion and are thus diluted out when a new round of plasmid DNA replication is blocked. When cells harboring type I mutant plasmids were grown at 43 degrees C in the absence of tetracycline, antibiotic-sensitive cells were segregated after a certain lag time. This lag most likely corresponds to a dilution of plasmids existing prior to the temperature shift. The synthesis of plasmid DNA in cells harboring type I mutant plasmids was almost completely blocked at 43 degrees C. It seems that these plasmids have mutations in the gene(s) necessary for plasmid DNA replication. Cells haboring a type II mutant plasmid exhibited neither segregation due to antibiotic sensitivity nor inhibition of plasmid DNA replication throughout cultivation at high temperature. It is likely that the type II mutant plasmid has a temperature-sensitive mutation in the tetracycline resistance gene. Antibiotic-sensitive cells haboring type III mutant plasmids appeared at high frequency after a certain lag time, and the plasmid DNA synthesis was partially suppressed at the nonpermissive temperature. They exhibited also a pleiotrophic phenotype, such as an increase of drug resistance level at 30 degrees C and a decrease in the number of plasmid genomes in a cell.",

Coliphages f2, R23, fd, and yamma formed plaques on mutant cells at both temperatures. Temperature-shift experiments showed that bacteriophage Q beta replication was blocked in the mutant within the first 20-30 min of infection. The defect did not prevent translation of the Qbeta polymerase gene or assembly of catalytically active Qbeta replicase molecules. In fact, mutant cells infected at 40 degrees hyperinduced replicase active both in vivo and in vitro. However, zone sedimentation of the in vivo RNA product showed it to consist of partially double-stranded material sedimenting at 9 S, with little or no viral 32S RNA. The 9S RNA was also found, along with a predominant peak of 32S RNA in parental cells infected at 40 degrees, but not in cells infected at 33 degrees. It thus appears that the temperature-sensitive component is required for viral RNA replication, but not for other RNA synthesis catalyzed by the replicase. Uninfected mutant cells grew normally at 40 degrees in nutrient broth, but not in glucose- or glycerol-minimal media. Revertants selected for their abillity to grow in minimal medium at 40 degrees also supported bacteriophage Qbeta replication at 40 degrees.",

Virus development is induced when cells transformed by this mutant are shifted to temperatures above 39 degrees C, but is not induced below this temperature. The plaque-purified, temperature-sensitive mutant virus confers heat inducibility to new host cells, indicating that the conditional function is a property of the viral genome. Unlike previously described temperature-sensitive SV40 mutants, in (ts)-1501 is capable of productive infection in permissive cells at the conditional temperature. The morphology, growth, and oncogenicity of in (ts)-1501-transformed cells at 37 degrees C are similar to those of cell lines transformed by wild-type SV40. HK10-c2(in(ts)-1501), a cloned cell line, transformed at 37 degrees C by the mutant virus, exhibits a transient increase in DNA synthesis before cell death at the conditional temperature. Many properties of in(ts)-1501 are analogous to those of the heat-inducible mutants of bacteriophages in which a heat-inactivated protein is responsible for the stable integration of the prophage in the bacterial chromosome.",

In cells infected with mutants W14, W28, and G11 at a low multiplicity (20 PFU/cells) secondary transcriptase activity was markedly temperature-sensitive after 3 and 5 h of infection at 30 degrees C. At a high multiplicity of infection (1000 PFU/cell) cells infected with W28 showed considerable RNA synthesis at 38 degrees C after 3 h at 30 degrees C.

    "input": "Cells infected by tsA mutants of simian virus 40 (SV40) overproduce early RNA. Overproduction results from failure of the temperature-sensitive A protein (T antigen) to inhibit early transcription. The amount of early RNA in the cytoplasm, determined quantitatively from the kinetics of hybridization to labeled complementary SV40 DNA, was elevated at both permissive (32 degrees C) and nonpermissive (41 degrees C) temperatures in all the early mutants tested (tsA7, -30, -58, and -209), but not in the late mutant tsB4. The amount of early RNA in a culture maintained at 32 degrees C for 72 h and then shifted to 41 degrees C was maximum when each cell was infected initially with at least one plaque-forming unit of tsA58. Azidocytidine (2'-deoxy-2'-azidocytidine), which inhibits initiation of DNA synthesis, did not cause overproduction of early RNA in cells infected with wild-type SV40, showing that the effect seen with tsA mutants is not due to interference with initiation of DNA synthesis per se. In parallel infections at 41 degrees C, the amount of early RNA per copy of viral DNA was as much as 2,000 times greater with tsA58 than with wild-type SV40, even though there was no replication of the tsA58 DNA. Synthesis of late RNA could not be detected during the first 20 h of an infection by either virus at 32 degrees C, indicating that late and early transcription are under different control. In three cell lines transformed by tsA mutants, the amount of early RNA increased moderately after a shift from 32 to 41 degrees C, whereas with homologous cells transformed by wild-type virus, the amount of early RNA decreased, indicating that the A protein may be able to repress transcription of integrated SV40 DNA. All the observations are consistent with a simple model in which the binding of A protein at the origin of replication blocks either binding of RNA polymerase to the early promoter or its progress through the early gene(s).",
    "output": "Azidocytidine did not cause overproduction of early RNA in cells infected with wild-type SV40. This suggests that the overproduction of early RNA seen in cells infected with tsA mutants of SV40 is not due to interference with initiation of DNA synthesis per se.

For both early and late mutants, the frequency of transformation was found to be up to 5-fold higher, and virus yield 100-fold lower, at 39 degrees than at 33 degrees. No such effect was observed with the wild type virus under the same conditions. This observation is apparently at variance with previously published work, but may be explained by the semipermissive nature of the cells that we used. Increasing the temperature to 40.5 degrees caused cells transformed by the early mutant, tsA30, to lose T-antigen as detectable by staining, and also to lose the ability to grow to high density, while it produced no effect on cells transformed by wild type virus.",
    "output": "When the temperature was increased to 40.5 degrees, cells transformed by the early mutant, tsA30, lost T-antigen as detectable by staining and also lost the ability to grow to high density.

Finally, a more precise analysis of the various RNA species synthesized was carried out. It appeared that the characteristics of RNA synthesis specified at 39.2 degrees C by tsIII or tsV mutants differed from the normal RNA synthesis of vesicular stomatitis virus wild type. Their common depression at 39.2 degrees C in virion-like RNA (38S) production--i.e., so-called genome replication--was tentatively paralleled with the concomitant ts events which have been previously shown to affect the two viral envelope proteins. An overproduction of the RNA transcripts was described for mutants in group III and posed the question of a regulation process to determine the amount of RNA to be transcribed.",

While the nutritional-physiological aspect of this therapeutic method is clear -- it depends on an accurate and sufficient supply of water, salts, glucose, amino-acids, triglycerides and essential fatty acids, vitamins and trace elements -- in practice it presents difficulties which though often serious are not insurmountable. Especially are to cite the septic complications, which are nearly imperceptible during their development. They are only to accept in view of the often almost hopeless condition of the child, who would be lost without complete parenteral feeding. Similar problems arise through metabolic complications which are caused non rarely only by insufficient dosages and lack of careful supervision but it is generally possible to correct these at an early stage. Complete parenteral nutrition must be exactly indicated. It is indeed a great therapeutic help, particularly when over a longer period -- at least a week or longer -- oral nutrition is impossible or insufficient. Practicall experiences will be reported.

By increasing protein supplies with a parenteral share of more than 50% during the three days, the nitrogen balances were positive on all days, although the calories supplied were far below the postulated optimum. On days 2 and 3, nitrogen retention was about 60% of the supply. Every 4 hrs after discontinuation of the 16 hr amino acid infusion, the amino acid levels in the plasma were examined by column chromatography. The resulting mean values did not show any imbalances of amino acid homeostasis.

Patients in good general condition who need parenteral nutrition for more than two days receive a \"basic nutrition\" with 0.8-1.0 g amino acids and 4-5 mg carbohydrates/kg body weight/day, which may be given via peripheral veins.

Six of them recovered after receiving parenteral alimentation for 3 to 15 days, gained weight during or after treatment and were discharged from the hospital in good conditions. Three died, one of them presented septicemia and two pneumonia and pulmonary infarcts. The solution used generated few metabolic alterations, the acid-base status remained within normal range and there were not important changes in the sodium and potassium serum concentrations. On the contrary, children with hyponatremia and hypokalemia at the beginning of the treatment, normalized these constants within the first hours, as diarrhea ceased. The most frequent complications were infiltrations and reaction of the surrounding tissue of the catheterized vein and local skin infection. Only one patient died of septicemia, possibly caused by this proceeding. In summary, parenteral alimentation though not free from risk, seems to be a useful proceeding when oral feeding is impossible or inadvisable. The utmost danger is septicemia. Metabolic changes are minimal and they do not mean a risk for child's life; nevertheless, there is a need for long term studies to bring up definite conclusions.

    "input": "Malnutrition is frequently present in patients with acute renal failure and may affect morbidity and mortality in this condition. When adequate nourishment cannot be given through the gastrointestinal tract, total parental nutrition with amino acids and hypertonic glucose may have beneficial results. Total parenteral nutrition has been reported to stabilize or reduce serum urea nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus levels, improve wound healing, enhance survival from acute renal failure, and possibly increase the rate of recovery of renal function. The optimal composition of the total parenteral nutrition infusate is unknown. Preliminary results of a double-blind study are reported in which one man received hypertonic glucose alone, two received glucose with essential amino acids (21 g/day), and three received glucose with essential (21 g/day) and nonessential (21 g/day) amino acids. All infusates were isocaloric. No differences were observed in serum urea nitrogen levels, serum urea nitrogen/creatinine ratios or urea appearance rates. Nitrogen balance was negative in all patients. The ratio of essential amino acids/nonessential amino acids were higher and the tyrosine/phenylalanine ratios were lower in plasma in the two patients receiving glucose with essential amino acids. No patient survived the hospitalization. In view of the markedly negative nitrogen balance frequently observed in these and earlier studies, the use of a different composition or quantity of amino acids, a higher energy intake, and anabolic hormones deserve further investigation.",

    "input": "In adults supplemental parenteral nutrition (PN) is advisable in burns over 40% especially when weight loss exceeds 10% of body weight. In children with smaller reserves and higher requirement of proteins and energy no rigid scheme for parenteral supplementation is used at our unit. In a young infant it may be added already at a 20-30% deep burn, especially with connected gastrointestinal tract problems, infection etc. Metabolic and protein requirements are estimated 50-100% in addition to their normal needs. Hypertonic glucose (gradually increased from 20-40%), covered with insulin in the early phase, is used as source of carbohydrates. L-amino acid mixture containing the \"pediatric essential amino acids\" histidine and cysteine is given as a nitrogen source. 20% Intralipid is given in a gradually increased amount of 2-4 g/kg per day to provide calories and essential fatty acids. Among electrolytes K, Ca, P and Mg must be added. Increased amounts of vitamin C and folate are needed by burned children. Vitamin E is also required during prolonged lipid administration. Trace elements (Zn. Fe, etc.) are supplied orally or i.v. with special solutions or fresh  plasma infusions. Our experience with parenteral nutrition in severely burned children will be presented. There were no severe metabolic side-effects but sepsis represented the major problem. The concomitant heat preservation by warming the room and use of infra-red heaters is emphasized.",
    "output": "A young infant with a deep burn of 20-30% may require supplemental parenteral nutrition, especially if there are associated gastrointestinal tract problems, infections, or any conditions that hinder the absorption of nutrients. This is due to the higher metabolic and protein requirements in children, which can be estimated to be 50-100% in addition to their normal needs. The source of carbohydrates is hypertonic glucose, and the nitrogen source is an L-amino acid mixture. Essential fatty acids are provided by 20% Intralipid, and among electrolytes, K, Ca, P, and Mg must be added. Additionally, increased amounts of vitamin C, folate, vitamin E, and trace elements (Zn, Fe, etc.) are needed.

As a control group (I) 10 patients were infused only with water, electrolytes and vitamins. A significant improvement of nitrogen balances was noticed in both groups of patients with parenteral nutrition, and about 90% of the infused amino acids was retained as nitrogen. However, the serum levels of various proteins--albumin, transferrin, pre-albumin and retinol-binding protein--presented no significant changes. There was no evidence that peripheral parenteral nutrition improved postoperative metabolism of plasma proteins. It is assumed that the administered amino acids are probably utilised in peripheral tissues (e.g. muscle, wound-repair) and are, therefore, not or only in low measures available for synthesis of plasma proteins in liver.",

    "instruction": "How many patients had hyperglycemia of a slight to moderate degree?",
    "input": "Thirty-six preterm, sick, low-birth-weight neonates were given either total or partial parenteral nutrition. The patients were divided into three groups according to their birth weights: group A -less than 1,000 gm, 12 patients: group B--between 1,000 and 1,500 gm, 15 patients: group C--more than 1,500 gm, 9 patients. The solution for total parenteral nutrition contained 20% glucose and 2.6% crystalline amino acids plus appropriate amounts of vitamins and minerals. The volume of infusate given was usually 125 ml/kg/day, but varied depending on the clinical condition of the patient; occasionally it was as high as 150 to 175 ml/kg/day. Infusate of one-half strength was administered initially; its concentrations of glucose and amino acids were increased to three quarters and full strength gradually, if tolerated. The solution for total parenteral nutrition was infused into the superior vena cava via a central venous catheter; that for partial parenteral nutrition was given into a peripheral vein to supplement inadequate oral feedings. The period of parenteral nutrition lasted from 5 to 49 days, with an average of 13.2 days. The intake of 500 mg of nitrogen as crystalline amino acids and 100 kcal as glucose was capable of achieving body weight gain. Positive nitrogen balance of various degrees was also observed. Hyperglycemia of a slight to moderate degree was observed in nine patients; only three required insulin therapy. Two patients had thrombotic occlusion of the central venous catheter. The conclusion was reached that total parenteral nutrition or partial parenteral nutrition, when properly managed, is a safe procedure in small, premature infants. The amino acid solution given as a nitrogen source along with adequate calories was effective in promoting weight gain and nitrogen balance; it was apparently well tolerated by low-birth-weight neonates.",

The study of measurable and descriptive characters showed a relative stability of the temporo-mandibular joint compared to the dynamism of the other components of the masticatory system. The functional specificity of the actual human temporo-mandibular joint seemed to be tightly associated to the main processes leading toward human evolution (facial regression, increase of the cranial capacity). On the other hand, this study casts some doubts regarding the utilization of Primates for experiments in this field.",
    "output": "The two main processes leading toward human evolution that are associated with the functional specificity of the actual human temporo-mandibular joint are facial regression and the increase of the cranial capacity. Facial regression refers to the gradual reduction in the size of the face relative to the brain in human evolution, which may have been driven by changes in diet and locomotion. The increase of the cranial capacity, on the other hand, is a hallmark of human evolution, and is believed to have allowed for the development of larger brains and increased cognitive abilities. Both of these processes have likely contributed to the unique adaptations of the human temporo-mandibular joint, which differ from those of other primates."

    "instruction": "What happened to the growth of bone at sutures in young animals after resection of sutures?",
    "input": "To find answers to the many questions about abnormal postnatal growth and change of the craniofacial skeleton, a series of surgical experiments was carried out in both young and adult animals. The purpose of this review is to relate this information to basic ideas about bone change and some local factors which may or may not affect skeletal changes. No gross regional deformity was noted after resection of sutures in young animals. The growth of bone at sutures was secondary or compensatory to other factors. In young animals, increase in size of the nasal or orbital cavities decelerated considerably after resection of either nasal septum or orbital tissues. With an increase in volume of orbital contents, orbital volume increased. These prominent gross changes in young animals were not noted in adult animals after resection of nasal septum, enucleation of the eye, or intrabulbar injection of silicone. After unilateral resection of the mandibular condyle in both young and adult monkeys, an extreme unilateral facial skeletal deformity developed. The important factor apparently was loss of integrity of the temporomandibular joint rather than loss of a growth site. The craniofacial skeleton, a three-dimensional mosaic of bones and cavities, develops as a result of the synchronous coordination of the differential activities at various sites. The dynamics of the growth and change are a fascinating, complex, incomplete chapter of biology. An understanding of factors that may or may not influence the craniofacial skeleton in both young and adult animals can aid diagnosis and surgical treatment.",
    "output": "After resection of sutures in young animals, the growth of bone at sutures was secondary or compensatory to other factors. The growth of nasal or orbital cavities decelerated considerably after resection of either nasal septum or orbital tissues. This suggests that the resection of sutures in young animals may affect the growth and development of certain craniofacial regions, particularly the nasal and orbital cavities. However, in adult animals, these prominent gross changes were not noted after resection of nasal septum, enucleation of the eye, or intrabulbar injection of silicone. This implies that the growth and development of the craniofacial skeleton may be more stable in adult animals compared to young animals after such interventions."

The histologic structures of condyle were quite different between the child group and other aged groups. The difference in the surface articular zone composed of the fibrous tissue was not so great in all age groups, while there was quite a difference in the structure in the remaining zones. It was clearly demonstrated by microradiogram that the osteons of the subarticular bone plate were more prominent in aging. Abnormal structures of the condyle were revealed in some individuals of the adult and old age groups, which were assumed probably to be the reactive remodelling against the functional changes of the temporomandibular joint.",

    "input": "The need for a \"model\" of the development of the head and the nervous system is examined. The purpose of such a model is to facilitate the testing of the probability of the correctness of anatomic and developmental ideas from a number of areas. Without such a model this information presents only a jumble of discordant facts. The proposed model suggests the following: 1. The nervous system of amphioxus tells us little, or nothing, about the ancestral vertebrate system. 2. The gap between the neural tube stage, established in the chordate, and the complex central nervous system typical of the vertebrate is partly closed by the identification of two stages. 3. The first of these stages assumes that the original anterior end of the nervous system corresponded with the anterior end of the notochord: thus it was at the anterior end of the present mesencephalon. Outgrowth of the anterior mesencephalic wall, totally sensory in nature, moved the neuropore anteriorly. This outgrowth is correlated with the gradual conversion of a velar mouth to a biting mouth by forward and downward extension of the head. 4. As a result of the anterior and downward expansion of the anterior wall of the mesencephalon, the cephalic flexure and infundibulum were produced. The primitive eye changed its relationship to the brain from attaching anterolateral to laterally; its point of attachment shifted from dorsal to the neuropore to ventral to the neuropore. 5. The nasohypophyseal field in the neural tube ancestor was closely associated with the anterior wall of the brain below the neuropore, and nerve fibers growing from this epithelium extended to the brain below (posterior?) to the optic stalk. With outgrowth, the fibers now entered the brain substance anterior to the optic stalk and dorsal (?) to the neuropore. 6. The second stage, which is well known from the literature, is the outgrowth of the telencephalic lobes from the dorsolateral and anterior wall of the \"diencephalon.\" 7. Among the vertebrates further elaboration of the system can be documented.",

The density at eight positions around each section was measured using radiographic and densitometric techniques. Analysis of variance indicated significant (p less than 0.02) differences among cross-sectional levels and positions within each level. No sexual dimorphism in density could be demonstrated, although sexual dimorphism in density has been reported for the femora of this same sample. This relationship between humerus and femur parallels that found in humans. Density increased distally in the humerus, probably due to major areas of muscle attachment. Comparison with similar data from the femur of Macaca indicated unexpected differences in density pattern which may underlie differences in the strength and mechanics of the upper and lower extremities.",

The Sylvian asymmetries may have existed in Neanderthal man and are found consistently in some apes. They may relate to right-left differences infunction. Thus, the striking auditory asymmetries could underlie language lateralization. The asymmetries in the frontal and occipital lobes and the lateral ventricles are correlated with hand preference.

    "input": "An alpha-feto-protein (AFP) is present in many mammals, in birds, and in sharks during development. The AFP present in different species have similar physicochemical properties and often have common antigenic determinants. Their study, both in health and disease, has provided a useful model for the understanding of other phase-specific antigens and the activation of the genes which control their synthesis. In the human fetus, the level of AFP falls with increasing maturity. The more sensitive methods of detection have disclosed that this fetal protein persists in trace amounts throughout life and its level increases in maternal blood during pregnancy. The principal sites of synthesis are the fetal liver and in some mammals, the yolk sac splanchnopleur. In humans as well as in mice and cows, it is notable that the synthesis of AFP is increased in liver cancer cells and that high levels of this protein are present in serum. Elevated values of AFP have also been detected in human subjects with undifferentiated tumours of the testis and ovary. A fall to normal levels has been noted in cases of complete remission after surgery and a return to high levels in patients who develop metastases. In some patients with hepatitis a temporary rise in the level of AFP has also been observed. In recent years, the detection of high levels of AFP in amniotic fluid has proved to be of great value for the prenatal diagnosis of neural-tube defects. Abnormal levels have also been found in the amniotic fluid or in maternal serum in cases of spontaneous abortion. Such measurements are now being assessed as a methodof monitoring abnormal pregnancy.",

    "instruction": "What is the maximum serum concentration of Alpha-fetoprotein typically found in healthy pregnant women?",
    "input": "Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is an alpha1-glycoprotein (M.W. about 65000) appearing in the fetal serum of most mammals including man during the early stages of pregnancy; 4 weeks after birth it disappears altogether or exists at very low concentrations as in the normal adult. AFP is formed in the yolk sac, the fetal liver and the gastro-intestinal tract. One of its physiological functions in fetal life is supposed to be the protection of the fetus from maternal oestrogens (oestrophilic property). The clinical significance of AFP is based on the regular and increasing production in primary liver cell carcinoma, less frequently in teratogenetic tumors where it serves as a control of therapy and course of the disease. Less frequent, minor and temporary increases in the AFP serum level occur in several primary tumors with secondary liver involvement, and in inflammatory gastro-intestinal diseases, e.g. of the liver (hepatitis, cirrhosis). AFP has an increasing importance in gynecology (gestational age, fetal distress syndrom, malformations, hydatidiform mole/chorion carcinoma). The physico-chemical properties of AFP are widely known. Both fetal and tumor AFP appear to be immunologically and biochemically identical, as are that of tissue and biological fluids. The differences observed (variants, microheterogeneity) depend mainly on the different content of sialic acid. An antigenetic relationship exists, between the AFP of most species. The immunodiffusion (Ouchterlony) is the most frequently used but relatively insensitive test (1-5 mug/ml) in finding AFP, whereas the radioimmunoassay is the most sensitive one (up to 0,25 ng/ml) and permits the determination of normal serum levels in adults (below 20 ng/ml). The serum concentration in healthy pregnant women lies up to 500 ng/ml, in patients with hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and other liver diseases mostly under 3 mug/ml, whereas in those with primary liver cell carcinoma levels up to and above 600 mg-percent have been found.",

    "instruction": "What is the typical range of AFP serum concentrations in normal adults as detected by radioimmunoassay?",
    "input": "Alpha1-fetoprotein (AFP) is an alpha1-glycoprotein which can be found in high concentration during fetal development in many mammals, birds, sharks and, also, man. The alpha-fetoproteins of various species have similar physico-chemical properties and often common antigenic determinants. Differences of microheterogeneity depend on a different content of sialin-acid. During human fetal development the serum AFP concentration falls with increasing gestational age. 4-5 weeks after birth AFP can be detected usually in low serum concentrations. Using more sensitive immunulogic techniques e.g. radioimmunoassay there was shown that AFP is present in sera of normal adults in concentrations of 10-20 ng/ml. AFP serum concentrations rise physiologically during pregnancy up to 500-550 ng/ml. During fetal development liver, yolk sac and gastrointestinal tract are the major sites of synthesis. In primary liver cell carcinoma, hepatoblastoma and in teratoblastoma containing yolk sac tissue AFP synthesis rises in tumor cells; the AFP serum concentration increases above 2 microgram/ml. In patients with benign liver diseases e.g. virus hepatitis, a transient rise of AFP serum concentrations was seen. Moreover, increased levels of AFP were found in hereditary diseases e.g. congenital tyrosinemia, ataxia-telangiectasia and in the amniotic fluid in congenital nephrosis of Finnish type. AFP assay in serum is clinically important for the control of course and treatment of primary liver cell carcinoma and teratoblastoma. AFP assay in amniotic fluid is a method for the prenatal detection of neural tube defects and the fetal distress syndrome, especially.",

Based on the immunoprecipitin turbidimetric reaction enhanced by polyethylene-glycol, the technique, simple and fast, gives precise and accurate results with following cautions: the antigen and antibody concentrations must be carefully chosen according to defined specific antiserum, and two dilutions of each serum sample must be assayed to control quite satisfactory determination and exhibit any antigen excess error. Large series of serum transferrin and IgA assays were studied and compared with radial immunodiffusion and continuous-flow immunonephelometric method: good correlations prove the value of the reported method.",

The quantitation was based on the comparison of the antibody activity of a serum to a standard curve obtained from a reference serum. This comparison was made automatically by a programmable calculator connected with the spectrophotometer. The assay was simplified further by use of specially designed disposable microcuvettes and micropipettes. The reproducibility of the test was good (1 SD = 5%), and the sensitivity for antibodies to influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus was 100-200 times greater than that of complement-fixation or hemagglutination-inhibition techniques. The technique seems especially suitable for virus laboratories in hospitals, where the time required for specific diagnosis of viral diseases can be shortened considerably, not only because of the simple performance of the test, but also because the greater sensitivity allows the shortening of the interval between successive samples of serum down to two or three days.",

The property of many antigens to become adsorbed firmly on to a hydrophobic polystyrene surface while retaining their serological reactivity is taken advantage of. On a surface with adsorbed antigen the corresponding immune serum is applied spot-wise. The antigen--antibody reaction areas on the surface are characterized by a distinct hydrophilic condensation pattern when exposed to water vapour. The results obtained by the immunoassay technique described can be reproduced with great accuracy. The method is well suited for quantitative determination of a wide range of antigens as well as their corresponding antibodies. Antigen concentrations of 0.2--0.8 mg/l and antibody concentrations about 1 mg/l can be detected. By employing an antiimmunoglobulin serum subsequent to the primary antigen--antibody reaction, an increase in sensitivity can be obtained.",

    "input": "A radioimmunoassay which can measure serum levels of antibody and antigen when both species are immuloglobulins (Igs) is described. The technique is based on competition between insolubilized Ig (bound to Sepharose) and serum Ig for radiolabeled Ig. For measurement of anti-Ig antibodies, labeled Ig antigen is added to a mixture of antibody-Sepharose and unknown or standard antibody solution. For measurement of antigen, labeled, purified antibody is added to a mixture of antigen-Sepharose and unknown or standard antigen solution. Although both assays can detect either Ig antigen or Ig antibody in a given unknown, the antibody assay requires 10-20 times as much antigen as antibody to achieve the same degree of inhibition, and the antigen assay is 100 times more sensitive for antigen than for antibody. By titrating the same unknown in both assays, one can determine whether inhibitory activity is due to antigen or antibody. The routine assay readily detects 1 microgram/ml of antibody or of antigen. A modified assay was also developed which detects levels of antibody as low as 5-10 ng/ml. The technique is simple and allows rapid screening of hundreds of serum samples in a short period of time. The assay can also be modified for measurement of anti-idiotype antibodies.",
    "output": "In the provided context, the amount of antigen required compared to antibody to achieve the same degree of inhibition in the antibody assay is 10-20 times greater for antigen.

It has been found necessary to employ certain control preparations in each study case in order to avoid interpretational errors which can derive from variation in distribution of plasma proteins, in preservation of immunoreactivity with different fixatives, and in nonspecific binding of antiserum. The method is suitable for detection of immunoglobulin components only among lymphoid cells corresponding to late stages in the (B-cell) sequence of transformation. One case has been identified in which the results of the method are inconsistent with additional data, that of large cell neoplasm of apparent epithelial nature with a monotypic immunoglobulin staining pattern.

The quantitation was based on a standard curve obtained by using a reference serum, for which the specific IgG content was assayed by immunochemical purification. IgG was first purified and specific rubella antibodies were separated by an immunoadsorbent prepared by linking rubella virus antigens to Sepharose 4B.

    "input": "In a further evaluation of the use of oral thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in puerperally lactating women, a radioimmunoassay for its measurement has been developed. Its concentration in plasma as well as that of prolactin (PRL), thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) were measured following either intravenous or oral administration of TRH. Basal concentrations of TRH in 14 normally cycling women ranged from less than 5 to 17 pg/ml. Two luteal phase studies produced peaks in plasma TRH 5 to 10 minutes after 100 micrograms of TRH administered intravenously with a return to basal concentrations within 2 to 3 hours. In 10 normally menstruating women, ingestion of 10 mg of TRH orally resulted in plasma TRH which peaked at 423 +/- 123 pg/ml (standard error of the mean) at 30-minutes. Plasma PRL, TSH, and T4 also increased and remained slightly elevated at 4 hours. These 8-hour studies were performed in a puerperal lactating woman who had ingested 10 mg of TRH orally twice a day for 7 days prior to blood sampling. TRH concentrations declined throughout each day while TSH rose slightly in the first 1 to 2 hours but remained within normal limits. The prolonged administration of 10 mg of TRH orally twice daily to three puerperally lactating women resulted in elevations in plasma TRH 2 to 3 hours following hormone administration, yet no significant increases in plasma TSH were observed. Both endogenous TRH and TSH were measured before and after 22 nursing events in nine puerperally lactating women. There was no change in the concentration of either substance and all values were similar to those obtained in normally menstruating women.",

    "input": "It has been suggested that prolactin is a regulator of aldosterone secretion. In order to test this hypothesis, we measured prolactin, thyrotrophin and aldosterone by radioimmunoassay and plasma renin activity by the radioimmunoassay of angiotensin I in eight normal women before and after the intravenous injection of 200 microgram of thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH). Prolactin increased from 4.1 +/- 1.1 ng/ml (mean +/- SE) to a peak of 27.4 +/- 3.8 (P less than 0.005) at 15 min following TRH. Plasma renin activity was not different from control levels (1.0 +/- 0.2 ng/ml/h) during the first hour following the administration of TRH, nor did the plasma aldosterone concentration differ significantly from the control levels (39 +/- 7 pg/ml) during this period. However, with upright posture, an increase in aldosterone (from 31 +/- 3 pg/ml at 1 h to 68 +/- 9 at 2 h, P less than 0.005) and in plasma renin activity (from 0.9 +/- 0.2 ng/ml/h at 1 h to 2.0 +/- 0.5 at 2 h, P less than 0.05) was noted, demonstrating a normal capacity to secrete aldosterone in these subjects. Similarly, no change in aldosterone was seen in nine patients with primary hypothyroidism given TRH, despite the fact that the increase in prolactin was greater than normal. Chronic hyperprolactinaemia was not associated with hyperaldosteronism in six patients with pituitary tumour. These data demonstrate that acutely or chronically elevated serum prolactin levels do not result in increased plasma aldosterone levels in humans.",

This L-dopa induced hGH release was significantly suppressed by the intravenous infusion of 1 mg of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). TRH administration alone had no significant effect on plasma hGH. In contrast, plasma human prolactin (hPRL) consistently increased following TRH infusion. L-dopa significantly lowered basal plasma hPRL levels and also significantly blunted TRH-induced hPRL release. These results suggest that TRH plays an inhibitory role in the regulation of hGH secretion in normal subjects, whereas it stimulates hPRL release.",
    "output": "The administration of L-dopa in normal subjects led to a significant decrease in basal plasma human prolactin (hPRL) levels.

In the 1st experiment, the low dose of TRH (0.077 microgram/min) had no effect on any hormone levels measured. Plasma TSH concentration increased significantly (p less than 0.05) in response to TRH infusion (0.77 microgram/min) in both experiments, but plasma TSH levels plateaued and then declined in both cases despite continued TRH infusion and irrespective of the presence or absence of a thyroid gland. A similar pattern of secretion, though less markedly decreased over time, was observed for plasma Prl in both experiments. The higher dose (0.77 microgram/min) of TRH had no effect on plasma GH concentration in the 1st infusion, but did result in a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in overall mean concentration of GH in both normal and THYX calves in the 2nd experiment. Removal of the thyroid gland, thus removing the source of increasing T4 and T3 levels seen in normal calves infused with TRH, failed to alter the secretory patterns of TSH and Prl. These data suggest that feedback inhibition by increasing plasma thyroid hormone concentrations was not responsible for the failure of TSH and, to a lesser extent, Prl to maintain chronically elevated plasma levels in response to continuous 24-h TRH infusion. It is suggested that a depletion of pituitary TSH and Prl stores readily secretable in response to a constant dosage level of TRH may be responsible for the secretory patterns observed.",

    "input": "An acute incubation procedure, using explanted normal rat hemipituitaries pretreated with fresh plasma obtained from pituitary donor animals, was employed to further investigate the in vitro stimulation of prolactin (PRL release by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). Pretreatment with dopamine (0.1 microgram/ml) caused a 30-50% decrease in the amount of PRL released into incubation media; the inhibitory effect of dopamine was not reversed by treatment with 0.5-6.0 ng. TRH, although these TRH concentrations consistently stimulated PRL release from pituitaries not exposed to dopamine. Treatment with thyroxine (10(-6) to 10(-5) M) showed a competitive inhibition of thyrotropin release by TRH (0.5 ng), but was without effect on TRH-stimulated PRL release. Cycloheximide (100 microgram/ml) blocked a net increase in PRL levels. TRH, nevertheless, significantly increased PRL release in the presence of cycloheximide. The results indicate that neither dopamine nor thyroxine compete with TRH in causing PRL release, and that the TRH stimulation of PRL release is unrelated to ongoing levels of hormone synthesis.",
    "output": "Cycloheximide blocked the net increase in PRL (prolactin) levels when it was present. However, TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) was still able to significantly increase PRL release even in the presence of cycloheximide.

In contrast, the.thyrotropin (TSH) response to TRH was unaffected by apomorphine (10.5+/-2.9 vs. 9.5+/-1.8 muU/ml, P greater than 0.5).

The basal plasma PRL concentration and the PRL response to TRH were both markedly increased by estrogen treatment. The TSH pituitary content remained unchanged, whereas the PRL pituitary content increased in parallel with the effect on PRL secretion. Treatment with estrogens for 1 wk sensitized the TSH secretory response to low doses of TRH (10 ng), whereas no significant effect on the response was found at high doses of the neurohormone. The present data show that the stimulatory effect of estrogens on the TSH response to TRH is due to true sensitization of the thyrotrophs to the action of the neurohormone, whereas that on prolactin secretion can result partly from increased pituitary prolactin content.",
    "output": "The daily administration of estradiol benzoate in intact male rats did not have a significant effect on the basal plasma Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level. Instead, it led to a twofold increase in the plasma TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) after 4 and 7 days of treatment.

The enterotoxigenic E. coli, producing heat-stable and/or heat-labile enterotoxin, were detected by use of assays in the Y1 adrenal cell, the Chinese hamster ovary cell, the rabbit ileal loop, and the infant mouse. The two tissue culture assays yielded comparable results in tests with 640 (193 positive, 447 negative) of 643 isolates of E. coli. The results of this study support the idea that enterotoxigenic E. coli play a significant role as pathogens in the etiology of acute watery diarrhea.",

    "input": "Escherichia coli strains isolated from newborn infants were injected intraperitoneally into infant rats. Strains possessing the K1 capsular polysaccharide antigen were significantly more virulent than strains lacking this antigen. When 5-day-old animals were injected with 1.2 X 10(1) colony forming units of a K1 E. coli strain (serotype O18ac:K1:H7), about 80% had bacteria isolated from their blood. Forty-eight percent of bacteremic animals had positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures. The development of bacteremia with greater than 10(4) colony-forming units per ml of blood correlated with positive cultures of cerebrospinal fluid. Some animals, studied with serial blood cultures, were able to clear bacteria spontaneously from their blood, whereas others succumbed to infection within 48 h of challenge.

    "input": "Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains represent the most frequent etiological agent of travelers diarrhea. Challenge studies with several of these strains were undertaken in volunteers to evaluate the mechanisms of disease-induced immunity. Seventeen students and other community volunteers were given 10(6) or 10(8) organisms of E. coli B7A (O148:H28), which produces heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxins. Ten individuals developed diarrheal illness closely resembling natural travelers diarrhea; of these ten, rises in titer of serum antitoxin and anti-O antibody occurred in eight (80%). Eight of the volunteers who developed diarrhea in the first test agreed to undergo rechallenge 9 weeks later with 10(8) B7A organisms. Only one of these eight \"veterans\" developed diarrhea versus seven of twelve controls given the same challenge (P = 0.05). Despite clinical protection, all \"veterans\" excreted B7A after rechallenge. Four controls who developed diarrhea during the homologous B7A rechallenge test were rechallenged 9 weeks later with 10(9) organisms of E. coli strain E2528-C1 (O25:H-), which produces only heat-labile enterotoxin and possesses a different O, H, and pili antigen composition than B7A. Three of four \"veterans\" and two of six controls developed comparable diarrhea. These studies demonstrate that prior disease due to enterotoxigenic E. coli confers homologous immunity against subsequent challenge, and the operative mechanism apparently is not bactericidal and is not mediated by serum anti-O antibodies. Heterologous protection was not conferred where the only common antigen was heat-labile enterotoxin, indicating that serum infection-derived antitoxin to heat-labile enterotoxin also is not protective.",

In two thirds of the 45 E. coli, isolated from acute intestinal infection of infants, different factors of virulence were found. The strains showed prevalently an enterotoxigenic character (66,6%), which was in correlation with the increased permeability (62,2%). Adhesive properties were present in 20% of E. coli independent of their enterotoxigenicity; only 11,1% of the strains had penetrating abilities. The rabbit skin model seems to be accurate and quick for ETEC screening purposes, as is the guinea-pig eye for the EIEC. The mouse intestinal loop has been found sensitive but time-consuming. The infant mouse model is simple and quick, but in this study it has not given optimal results. The Vero cell culture system is simple and easy to perform, but at least for some strains the preparations should be concentrated. The investigation of adhesiveness by haemagglutination is possible to conduct in every small clinical laboratory. Our opinion is, however, that after the isolation of E. coli from different pathological materials, the determination of the antigenic structure of the strains is necessary and later on the additional biological characterization should be performed.",

Two strains (O142 and O127) caused diarrhoea. L.T. or S.T. enterotoxins were not found in E. coli stool isolates from individuals with diarrhoea and no one had a rise in L.T. antitoxin titre; the findings suggest that L.T. and S.T. enterotoxins were not involved in pathogenesis of the diarrhoea. Non-invasive E.P.E.C. strains probably induce diarrhoea by a mechanism (presumably an enterotoxin) distinct from L.T. or S.T. enterotoxins.",

    "input": "Enteropathogenic serotypes of Escherichia coli which have been incriminated by epidemiological evidence as responsible for epidemics of acute diarrhea in infants are often found to be nontoxigenic when tested by conventional systems such as Y1-adrenal, Chinese hamster ovary, and suckling mouse assays. Twelve such strains, representing four different enteropathogenic serotypes, were examined for their capacity to elaborate toxic materials which alter water transport. Ultrafiltration fractions prepared to contain either a high-molecular-weight, heatlabile or a low-molecular-weight, heat-stable form of toxin from each strain were perfused through rat jejuna in graded concentrations ranging from 100 mug to 0.1 ng/ml. Ten of the twelve enteropathogenic strains produced one or both toxin forms that induced water secretion at concentrations of 1 to 10 ng/ml. Values in this range are considered indicative of clinically significant enterotoxigenicity in this assay system, and toxins from well-documented toxigenic strains examined in this study were active at these same concentrations. Similar preparations from ten control strains from healthy persons were either inactive or evoked water secretion only at concentrations of 10 to 100 mug/ml. These observations suggest that enteropathogenic serotypes of E. coli isolated from epidemics of infantile diarrhea produce diarrhea by elaborating potent heat-labile and heat-stable toxin forms which alter water transport but which are inactive in conventional assay systems. The manner in which these toxins differ either quantitatively or qualitatively from those which stimulate the conventional test systems is unknown.",

    "input": "Human skeletal natural actomyosin contained actin, tropomyosin, troponin and myosin components as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Purified human myosin contained at least three light chains having molecular weights (+/-2000) of 25 000, 18 000 and 15 000. Inhibitory and calcium binding components of troponin were identified in an actin-tropomyosin-troponin complex extracted from acetone-dried muscle powder at 37 degrees C. Activation of the Mg-ATPase activity of Ca2+-sensitive human natural or reconstituted actomyosin was half maximal at approximately 3.4 muM Ca2+ concentration (CaEGTA binding constant equals 4.4 - 10(5) at pH 6.8). Subfragment 1, isolated from the human heavy meromyosin by digestion with papain, appeared as a single peak after DEAE-cellulose chromatography. In the pH 6-9 range, the Ca2+-ATPase activity of the subfragment 1 was 1.8- and 4-fold higher that the original heavy meromyosin and myosin, respectively. The ATPase activities of human myosin and its fragments were 6-10 fold lower than those of corresponding proteins from rabbit fast skeletal muscle. Human myosin lost approximately 60% of the Ca2+-ATPase activity at pH 9 without a concomitant change in the number of distribution of its light chains. These findings indicate that human skeletal muscle myosin resembles other slow and fast mammalian muscles. Regulation of human skeletal actomyosin by Ca2+ is similar to that of rabbit fast or slow muscle.",

    "instruction": "What is the suggested initial step in the activation of myosin that leads to contraction?",
    "input": "In vertebrate smooth muscle actomyosin and myofibrils a myosin light chain of molecular weight about 20,000 becomes phosphorylated at the same Ca2+ concentration as required to stimulate the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin. Further, the degree of phosphorylation in the preparations as well as in various reconstituted actomyosins is proportional to their measured Ca2+ sensitivity. The phosphorylation process is very rapid and is essentially completed before the rise in ATPase activity. The enzyme responsible for the observed myosin phosphoylation is a specific myosin light chain kinase which is routinely co-purified with myosin. This kinase is normally present in actomyosin and its removal together with tropomyosin leads to a complete loss of the actin-activated ATPase activity. It is suggested that the Ca-dependent phosphorylation of the light chain via the light chain kinase represents the initial step in the activation of myosin that leads to contraction. Relaxation is probably effected by an as yet uncharacterised light chain phosphatase.",

An actomyosin can be readily extracted from these myofibrils at low ionic strength and in yields 20 times as high as previously reported. The protein composition of all preparations has been monitored using dodecylsulfate-gel electrophoresis. By this method smooth muscle actomyosin showed primarily only the major proteins, myosin, actin and tropomyosin, while the myofibrils contained, additionally, three new proteins not previously described with polypeptide chain weights of 60000, 110000 and 130000. The ATPase activities of both the myofibrils and actomyosin preparations are considerably higher than previously described for vertebrate smooth muscle. They are sensitive to micromolar Ca2+ ion concentrations to the same degree as comparable skeletal and cardiac muscle preparations, even though troponin-like proteins could not be identified in these smooth muscle preparations. From the latter observation and the presence of Ca2+-sensitivity in tropomyosin-free actomyosin it is suggested that this calcium sensitivity is, as in some invertebrate muscles, a property of the myosin molecule.",
    "output": "The suggested property of the myosin molecule in vertebrate smooth muscle preparations, as suggested by the provided context, is a calcium sensitivity, similar to that observed in some invertebrate muscles. This property is present in tropomyosin-free actomyosin, indicating that the calcium sensitivity may be inherent to the myosin molecule itself, rather than being mediated by troponin-like proteins."

Phosphorylated and dephosphorylated smooth muscle myosin. Phosphorylated and dephosphorylated smooth muscle myosin were purified from this ammonium sulfate fraction by gel filtration, which also separated the kinase and the phosphatase from the myosin. Purified phosphorylated and dephosphorylated myosin have identical stained patterns after sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. They also have similar ATPase activities measured in 0.5 M KCl in the presence of K+-EDTA and Ca2+. However, the actin-activated myosin ATPase activity is markedly increased after phosphorylation. Moreover, the actin-activated ATPase activity of phosphorylated myosin is inhibited by the removal of Ca2+ in the absence of any added regulatory proteins. Dephosphorylation of myosin results in a decrease in the actin-activated ATPase activity. Skeletal muscle tropomyosin markedly increased the actin-activated ATPase activity of phosphorylated but not dephosphorylated myosin in the presence, but not in the absence, of Ca2+.",
    "output": "The removal of Ca2+ has an inhibitory effect on the actin-activated ATPase activity of phosphorylated myosin. This inhibition occurs in the absence of any added regulatory proteins.

A comparative study of the enzymatic properties of myosin from two types of tissues, showed the following differences: (1) in the dependence the Ca2+-ATPase activity on the KCl concentration in the incubation medium; (2) in the degree of myosin activation by actin in the presence of Mg2+; (3) in the behaviour of Ca2+-ATPase dependence on pH; (4) the different temperature optima of the ATPase activity.",

It has been shown that in normal adult muscles the electrophoretic pattern of light chains of myosin reflects the myosin ATPase activity only when muscles from the same animal species are compared. In homologous muscles from adult animals differing in size, the size-dependent difference in myosin ATPase activity is not revealed in the electrophoretic pattern. Both in developing and in denervated muscle, changes in myosin ATPase activity are either connected with changes in the pattern of light chains of myosin or this pattern does not change. This relation is different in fast and slow muscles and also differs in chick and rabbit muscles. There are several possibilities of explaining the relation between ATPase activity of myosin and the pattern of light chains of myosin. The observation that myosin from the soleus muscle of 1-month-old rabbit contains light chains corresponding to both fast and slow type of myosin, indicates that the change in myosin ATPase activity during development is due to changes in the ratio between the fast and slow type of myosin.",

    "input": "Actin, myosin, and \"native\" tropomyosin (NTM) were separately isolated from chicken gizzard muscle and rabbit skeletal muscle. With various combinations of the isolated contractile proteins, Mg-ATPase activity and superprecipitation activity were measured. It was thus found that gizzard myosin and gizzard NTM behaved differently from skeletal myosin and skeletal NTM, whereas gizzard actin functioned in the same wasy as skeletal actin. It was also found that gizzard myosin preparations were often Ca-sensitive, that is, that the two activities of gizzard myosin plus actin without NTM were activated by low concentrations of Ca2+. The Mg-ATPase activity of a Ca-insensitive preparation of gizzard myosin was not activated by actin even in the presence of Ca2+. When Ca-sensitive gizzard myosin was incubated with ATP (and Mg2+) in the presence of Ca2+, a light-chain component of gizzard myosin was phosphorylated. The light-chain phosphorylation also occurred when Ca-insensitive myosin was incubated with gizzard NTM and ATP (plus Mg2+) in the presence of Ca2+. In either case, the light-chain phosphorylation required Ca2+. Phosphorylated gizzard myosin in combination with actin was able to exhibit superprecipitation, and Mg-ATPase of the phosphorylated gizzard myosin was activated by actin; the actin activation and superprecipitation were found to occur even in the absence of Ca2+ and NTM or tropomyosin. The phosphorylated light-chain component was found to be dephosphorylated by a partially purified preparation of gizzard myosin light-chain phosphatase. Gizzard myosin thus dephosphorylated behaved exactly like untreated Ca-insensitive gizzard myosin; in combination with actin, it did not superprecipitate either in the presence of Ca2+ or in its absence, but did superprecipitated in the presence of NTM and Ca2+. Ca-activated hydrolysis of ATP catalyzed by gizzard myosin B proceeded at a reduced rate after removal of Ca2+ (by adding EGTA), whereas that catalyzed by a combination of actin, gizzard myosin, and gizzard NTM proceeded at the same rate even after removal of Ca2+. However, addition of a partially purified preparation of gizzard myosin light-chain phosphatase was found to make the recombined system behave like myosin B. Based on these findings, it appears that myosin light-chain kinase and myosin light-chain phosphatase can function as regulatory proteins for contraction and relaxation, respectively, of gizzard muscle.",
    "output": "In the Ca-insensitive preparation of gizzard myosin, the addition of actin, even in the presence of Ca2+, did not activate the Mg-ATPase activity. This suggests that the Ca-insensitive gizzard myosin requires other regulatory proteins, such as gizzard NTM or myosin light-chain kinase, for activation by actin. The absence of activation in the presence of Ca2+ indicates that Ca2+ may not be the primary regulator of Mg-ATPase activity in this Ca-insensitive preparation."

The purified myosin shows high ATPase activity in the presence of EDTA or Ca2+ and a low activity in the presence of Mg2+. The Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity is stimulated by rabbit skeletal muscle actin. The presumptive retinal myosin possesses a major component which has a mobility in sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis similar to that of the heavy chain of bovine skeletal muscle myosin. Electron microscopy showed retinal myosin to form bipolar filaments in 0.1 M KCl. It is concluded that the retina possesses a protein with enzymic and structural properties similar to those of muscle myosin.",

While the myosin shows high ATPase activity in the presence of EDTA or Ca2+, its activity is significantly lower in the presence of Mg2+.

The proteins of the actin complex were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Half-maximal activation of the cardiac actomyosin was seen at a calcium concentration of 1.2 +/- 0.002 (S.E. of mean) muM.

The Ca2+-dependent cooperativity was of a mixed type as determined from Hill plots for homologous reconstituted bovine cardiac and rabbit fast skeletal actomyosin.

The examination time intervals ranged between 18 and 115 months. 2. A total of 83 teeth were lost between examinations. 3. Excluding a patient who lost 25 teeth, a total of 58 teeth were lost. The adjusted tooth loss was 0.61 tooth per patient per year (or 0.36 with the elimination of 22 \"hopeless\" teeth). 4. The mandibular and maxillary molars had the greatest percentage of tooth loss between examinations. 5. All 29 patients completing the study had progessive increases in pocket depth during their time in the study. Increases in the mean annual pocket depths per tooth per patient varied from 0.24 millimeter per year to 2.46 millimeters per year. 6. The disto-lingual and mesio-lingual interproximal surfaces had the greatest increases in surface pocket depths. The lingual and buccal surfaces had the smallest increases in pocket depth. 7. The rate of increase in pocket depths was less in patients over 44 years of age. 8.

    "input": "In order to carry out the proper prosthetic treatment, it is necessary to select the method of treatment on the basis of accurate information concerning the prognosis of the prosthetic appliance. The oral structures are particularly proved to change when partial dentures are being used because the structures of the partial dentures are quite complex and they are easily broken. Therefore, in an attempt to analyze the changes that occur in the oral structures and partial dentures after insertion of the partial dentures, we conducted 3 series of follow-up examinations. The author sent out questionnaires and also conducted follow-up examinations of the patients. A summary of the major findings is as follows: 1) The percentage of those patients who came for their follow-up examinations, using metal based dentures, rose sharply over time. There were only 11.99% of the patients using the metal based dentures at the time the first study was conducted, but this rose to 58.13% at the time of the second study and 73.73% at the time of the third study. 2) The proportion of the patients who had anterior partial dentures declined over time from 9.36% at the time of the first study to 8.74% at the time of the second study and finally to 5.61% at the time of the third study. 3) The proportion of the partial dentures that had fractured was 23.15% at the time of the first study and 16.37% at the time of the second study and 16.67% at the time of the third study. 4) There was a striking difference in the fracture frequency of the acrylic resin based partial dentures and that of the metal based partial dentures. The denture bases of the acrylic resin-based partial dentures fractured about four times as often as those of the metal based partial dentures. 5) In all three studies it was found that about 60% of the caries occuring on the abutment tooth occurred on the edentulous proximal side. 6) Changes in the mucous membrane, such as inflammation or development of ulcers, had occurred in 48.86% of the cases at the time of the first study. This proportion declined to approximately 47% at the time of the second and finally to 43% at the time of the third study. 7) In examining the changes in the mobility of the abutment teeth, it was found that in all three studies approximately 20 to 30% of the abutment teeth demonstrated increased mobility, and about 10 to 20% showed decreased mobility while 55 to 65% showed no change.",

Cephalometric radiographs were made for each of 64 patients at initial placement of the dentures and for all active patients at five yearly recall visits. These radiographs were measured to determine rates of mandibular bone loss, maxillary bone loss, loss of total face height, rotation of the mandible, and migration of the denture bases over the 5-year period. At the end of the study no statistically significant differences between the two groups of patients could be found.

Different cephalometric landmarks were identified, and eighteen different measurements or calculations were used to describe the mandible, maxillary-mandibular complex, and dental relationships. Univariate longitudinal facial growth profiles and mean vector analyses as well as multivariate comparisons were performed between male, female, and combined non-cleft and cleft groups. Linear data comparisons indicated statistically significant differences in the growth profile of those measurements describing the changes in the relationship of the lower border of the mandible (MP:SN angle) and the y-axis to the anterior cranial base (NSGn). The maxillary-mandibular relationship (angles ANB and NAPog) and dimensions (Ans-PTm/Pog) exhibited statistically significant differences in the growth profiles of the non-cleft and cleft groups. Such differences were also found in the relationship of the lower incisors to the mandibular plane (1:MP angle). The mean vector analysis for the dental measurements pointed to significant differences for all comparisons made, particularly in the combined non-cleft groups. These measurements were of larger magnitude in the non-cleft group than in the cleft group except for the interincisal angle (1:1), which was larger in clefts.",

In these patients, tongue pressures were low initially, especially pressures by the sides of the tongue in the molar region. After surgical retraction of the incisors, tongue pressures increased, but the increases brought pressures up to normal levels from the previous abnormally low values. The data are consistent with the view that function (swallowing) adapts to oral form, rather than the other way around.",

Initially, these pressures were low, especially on the sides of the tongue in the molar region.

The observation period varied from 1 to 3 years. The clinical and radiographic findings revealed complete recovery in 59% of the involved teeth. The degree of periodontal and pulpal complications were closely related to the displacement between the fragments and to the type of fracture. Six different fracture types were classified with regard to the extent of involvement of the tooth supporting tissue; 23% of the teeth which initially responded negatively to electric stimulation showed positive sensibility at the time of reexamination. Thus, a long time observation period is advisable with regard to the final outcome of the pulp damage. Conservative treatment of teeth involved in the line of mandibular fractures has a favorable prognosis especially if optimal reduction of the jaw fragments is achieved.",

    "input": "In hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism, pharmacologic doses of vitamin D correct hypocalcemia, but the mechanism is unknown. In two children with hypoparathyroidism and one with pseudohypoparathyroidism we tested the hypothesis that in these conditions there is a defect in synthesis of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the principal active metabolite of vitamin D. In both conditions, minute doses of the metabolite (0.04 to 0.08 mug per kilogram of body weight per day) quickly corrected hypocalcemia and increased intestinal calcium absorption. On the other hand, the effective dose of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to maintain normocalcemia was 3 to 4 mug per kilogram per day in the two conditions. Thus, the dosage ratio of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 approximated 100:1. By contrast this ratio was approximately 3:1 in two infants with vitamin D deficiency, a condition in which optimal metabolism of vitamin D would be expected. These findings suggest an impaired conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in both hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism.",

    "input": "1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25(OH)2D3] was studied in a double-blind controlled fashion in patients on chronic dialysis. Serum calcium was unchanged in 16 patients on vitamin D3 (D3) (400 to 1200 IU/day). In 15 patients on 1,25(OH)2D3 (0.5 to 1.5 microgram/day), serum calcium increased from 9.05 +/- .15 to 10.25 +/- .20 mg/dl (p less than 0.001), returning to 9.37 +/- .16 mg/dl (p less than 0.001) in the post control period. Patients on D3 showed no reversible decrease in immunoreactive parathyroid hormone levels, but patients on 1,25(OH)2D3 did, from a control of 1077 +/- 258 to 595 +/- 213 microliter equivalents/ml (p less than 0.01), and returned to 1165 +/- 271 microliter equivalents/ml (p less than 0.005). Nine of 12 patients on D3 who underwent serial iliac-crest biopsies showed histologic deterioration, and six of seven who received 1,25(OH)2D3 were improved or unchanged (p less than 0.025). Bone mineral and calcium decreased in patients on D3 (p less than 0.05) but not in those on 1,25(OH)2D3. Hypercalcemia occurred in five of 15 patients. We conclude that 1,25(OH)2D3 has a calcemic effect in chronic dialysis patients, decreases levels of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone, and is associated with histologic improvement in bone disease. Thus, 1,25(OH)2D3 is a valuable adjunct to the management of renal osteodystrophy but requires monitoring of serum calcium to avoid hypercalcemia.",

    "instruction": "What conditions have been shown to be caused by vitamin D deficiency in Asian immigrants to Britain and the elderly?",
    "input": "Highly sensitive assays have been developed that enable 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-hydroxyvitamin D3) and 25-hydroxyergocalciferol (25-hydroxyvitamin D2) to be measured in the same serum sample. With these assays it has been shown that endogenously produced cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is important in man; the findings further emphasize the role of vitamin D metabolites as hormones rather than vitamins in the traditional sense. Dietary sources of vitamin D appear to be inadequate and vitamin D deficiency has been shown to the cause of rickets and osteomalacia in Asian immigrants to Britain. This condition may be readily treated with small doses of vitamin D. In addition, sub-clinical deficiency was found in the Asian community. In the elderly, also, vitamin D deficiency was established as an important cause of osteomalacia and again evidence for the existence of a sub-clinical deficiency state was found. It is therefore suggested that the present prophylactic practices should be reviewed. Secondary hyperparathyroidism (reflected by elevated concentrations of circulating immunoassayable parathyroid hormone) was shown to be the rule rather than the exception in vitamin D deficiency. Some patients, however, had failed to respond to a hypocalcaemic stimulus. In others, there were high concentrations of parathyroid hormone despite normal serum calcium concentrations. Thus the relationship between parathyroid hormone and metabolites of vitamin D may not be mediated through changes in serum calcium alone, and it is postulated that metabolites of vitamin D may directly affect the secretion of parathyroid hormone.",
    "output": "Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to cause rickets and osteomalacia in Asian immigrants to Britain and the elderly. Rickets is a softening of the bones in children, while osteomalacia is a softening of the bones in adults. The condition can be treated with small doses of vitamin D. Additionally, sub-clinical deficiency has been found in both the Asian community and the elderly. This means that the deficiency may not be severe enough to cause noticeable symptoms but can still have negative effects on health. Secondary hyperparathyroidism, reflected by elevated concentrations of circulating immunoassayable parathyroid hormone, is often seen in vitamin D deficiency. However, some patients may not respond to a hypocalcaemic stimulus, and in others, there may be high concentrations of parathyroid hormone despite normal serum calcium concentrations.

The plasma concentration of 25-OHD3 fell from 14.1 ng/ml in 1-day-old chicks to undetectable levels after 3 weeks on a rachitogenic diet. Circulating 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 hormone also decreased from 8.9 ng/100 ml to undetectable levels at 3 weeks in these chicks. Chicks receiving an optimal supplement of vitamin D3 (1.4 IU/g diet) for three to four weeks had plasma 25-OHD3 and 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 levels of 21-35 ng/ml and 5.1-7.5 ng/100 ml, respectively. Nutritional supplementation with a 50-fold excess of vitamin D3 (70 IU/g diet) elicited a substantial increase in plasma 25-OHD3 to 87-130 ng/ml, while plasma 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 was not increased. Increasing dietary calcium from 1.4 to 2.8% did not alter the circulating level of vitamin D3 metabolites in chicks fed 1.4 IU of vitamin D3/g diet. Direct measurement of the renal 25-OHD3-1 alpha-hydroxylase in vitro, showed that lowering dietary calcium or exclusion of vitamin D3 stimulated the biosynthesis of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3, but raising calcium did not alter the enzyme activity. It is concluded that the circulating concentration of the 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 hormone in the chick is unaffected by abnormally high intakes of vitamin D3 or calcium, but the renal production of the hormone increases during vitamin D3 or calcium deprivation. Additional studies in rats fed a diet supplemented with either 2 or 1000 IU of vitamin D3/g verify that the circulating concentration of 25-OHD3 is markedly increased when the dietary intake of vitamin D3 is elevated. Moreover, 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 is not increased under these conditions, but actually falls significantly when the dietary level of vitamin D3 is raised from 2 to 1000 IU/g. These studies in both the chick and rat indicate that dietary vitamin D3 excess enhances circulating 25-OHD3, probably because the vitamin D3-25-hydroxylase enzyme is not strigently controlled. The fact that the circulating 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 is not concomitantly increased may reflect either decreased synthesis or increased utilization of the 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 sterol.",

This was associated with an increase in serum calcium levels and reduction in PTH levels. In the children with CRF, secondary hyperparathyroidism was improved with treatment but its development was not completely prevented nor was healing complete. In the patients receiving RDT, treatment with vitamin D improved the changes associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism in 50% of cases but these features sometimes reappeared despite continuing treatment. Hypercalcaemia or metastatic calcification was not seen. Subsequently, 1,25(OH)2D3 was administered to 14 children receiving RDT. This was associated with the return of serum calcium levels to normal, inhibition of PTH synthesis and an improvement in intestinal calcium absorption. Fibro-osteoclasia was cured and there was improvement in actual bone resorption. There was also improvement in osteoidosis in those children who showed disturbances of mineralisation. Calcification in the limbus area of the eyes may occur and hypercalcaemia was seen commonly. Treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 should only be offered to children with severe renal bone disease.

D3 had similar, but less pronounced effects. 7 out of 8 patients on 1,25(OH)2D3, developed hypercalcaemia which necessitated a reduction in dosage.

An impaired end organ responsiveness to 1,25(OH)2D was suggested by a low intestinal calcium absorption in the face of high serum 1,25(OH)2D. Moreover, there may have been a defective vitamin D-25-hydroxylase, since there was a relative refractoriness to treatment with large doses of vitamin D2, an inappropriately low serum 250HD after vitamin D2 therapy, and a responsiveness to treatment with 25OHD3.",

The effect produced by sera from cancer patients on in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis was tested on autologous cells and on homologous cells from a constant panel of 10 normal volunteers. Patients with cancer showed a distinct deficiency of cellular immune responsiveness reflected in a stage-related impairment of PHA and MLC reactivity. This deficiency seems at least partially attributable to the presence of lymphocyte depressive factors in cancer sera, since such sera reduced the reactivity of both autologous and normal homologous lymphocytes to a level that was significantly lower than that found in the presence of pooled normal serum.

The percentages of T and B lymphocytes appeared to be normal in all groups, but the ranges of values were somewhat greater than among the normal controls. The mean total numbers of B lymphocytes were normal in all patient groups. All reductions seemed to be more pronounced in patients with disseminated than in those with localized disease, but none of these differences was statistically significant.

It seems that human malignant, neoplastic diseases are associated with a relatively selective reduction of the total numbers and reactivity of blood T lymphocytes. Various explanations of the reactivity impairment are proposed. The pathogenesis of the reduction of the total number of blood T lymphocytes remains obscure.",
    "output": "The mean total numbers of B lymphocytes were found to be normal in all patient groups, including Hodgkin's disease, lymphosarcoma, reticulosarcoma, various solid tumors, and the control group. This suggests that the reduction in lymphocyte numbers and reactivity observed in these patient groups is more associated with T lymphocytes rather than B lymphocytes."

    "input": "Lymphocyte function was examined in Wegener's granulomatosis patients and the following results were obtained. 1) The T and B lymphocyte subpopulation was within the normal range. 2) Lymphocyte blast formation was examined with the use of PHA-P, Con A or TAP (tuberculin active peptide). A decrease in responsiveness against TAP was found in four out of ten patients, but no decrease was observed in responsiveness agains Con A or PHA-P. 3) Skin tests were carried out on seven patients with six different antigens. In two out of seven patients, the skin reactions were decreased against all the antigens used. In the other five patients, skin reactions were observed against only one or two of the antigens used. These results suggest that Wegener's granulomatosis may be associated with a partial deficiency in the cellular immune mechanism.",

    "input": "In untreated patients with Hodgkin's disease the percentage of T-lymphocytes was significantly reduced in comparison to healthy controls independent of the stage of the disease. The absolute number of T-lymphocytes was also reduced in most patients. The response of lymphocytes after PHA-stimulation was diminished parallel with the skin reactivity: Normal results were obtained in early stages and with favorable histological types whilst low values were found in stages III and IV and in unfavourable histological types. A correlation between the percentage of T-lymphocytes and the PHA-stimulation was found in early stages, but not in stages III and IV. There was also a correlation between the absolute number of T-lymphocytes and skin reactivity. The percentage of DNA-synthesizing lymphocytes was significantly higher than in normal blood. The highest values were found in stages III and IV and in unfavourable histological types. After radiation therapy the T-lymphopenia, the diminished PHA-stimulation as well as anergy was more pronounced than after chemotherapy.",

    "input": "Lymphopenia and monocytosis were found in one third of untreated myeloma patients but there was no correlation between the two. Half of the patients studied had an increase in medium basophilic lymphoid cells, and eight had a raised PAS score. Lymphocytes from the majority of untreated myeloma patients failed to respond to antigenic stimulation in vitro compared with age matched controls. Three patients were immunized but showed no increase in immunoblasts or rise in antibody titre. The findings strongly suggest that abnormal lymphocytes are present in the blood in myeloma. The failure of lymphocytes to respond to antigen provides an explanation for the lack of normal plasma cells and depressed antibody responses in myeloma.",
    "output": "The context does not provide a specific percentage of untreated myeloma patients who had an increase in medium basophilic lymphoid cells. However, it does state that half of the patients studied had an increase in these cells. Therefore, it can be inferred that approximately 50% of the untreated myeloma patients had an increase in medium basophilic lymphoid cells."

    "input": "The reactivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with advanced malignancy was assessed by mitogen-induced stimulation of protein synthesis as measured by 3H-leucine incorporation. It was confirmed that the lymphocyte response of patients was depressed. Furthermore, the lymphocytes of 15 out of 27 cancer patients, selected because of their low responses, inhibited the reactivity of normal lymphocytes in co-cultures. The lymphocytes from one patient with Hodgkin's disease were also inhibitory. In contrast, lymphocytes from healthy subjects, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, lymphosarcoma or multiple myeloma caused no suppression. Experiments with purified cell populations from patients with carcinoma indicated that purified T cells responded to mitogens while unseparated lymphocytes failed to respond and that the inhibitory activity was due to adherent cells, presumably monocytes. There was no evidence for B-cell-mediated suppression. However, in two cases inhibition was caused by isolated T cells of the patients and not by adherent cells. These experiments suggested that one mechanism for the depression of cell-mediated immunity seen in patients with advanced cancer may be the nonspecific suppresssion of certain T-cell functions by circulating monocytes.",

Both IgM and IgD surface immunoglobulins were resynthesized after these cells were trypsinized and cultured. Aggregate or Fc receptors were demonstrated on hairy cells. The ability to phagocytose latex was also a property of hairy cells; however, these cells did not demonstrate nonspecific esterase activity. Stimulation by phytohemagglutinin resulted in very low incorporation of tritiated thymidine. Cytofluorographic analysis of the phytohemagglutinin-stimulated cell population revealed less than 9% of the cells in an interploid or tetraploid state. The abnormal mitogen response was largely restored when purified T lymphocytes obtained from the peripheral blood of the patients were cultured with phytohemagglutinin. Hairy cells cultured with normal allogeneic mononuclear cells did not undergo blast transformation. These data strongly suggest that the cells of at least some patients with hairy cell leukemia are B lymphocytes with phagocytic capabilities.",

Patients with systemic metastases (stage IV) and those with evidence of tumor burden had fewer positive DTH reactions for recall antigens than did patients with localized disease (stage I), patients with no evidence of tumor burden, and 227 normal controls. However, no differences were found in the magnitude of response among patients with melanoma or when compared with controls. Patients with melanoma had fewer responses to dinitrochlorobenzene (40% than did controls (98%), but there were no differences by stage or tumor burden. Similarly, blastogenesis in the presence of PHA, Con A, and PWM was depressed when compared with controls, but there was no meaningful correlation with the clinical status. Leukocyte, T cell, or B cell counts revealed no alteration from normal for the patients with melanoma. The usefulness of these studies for routine clinical monitoring is questioned.",

The responding capacity to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) was markedly depressed and delayed in all three groups of patients  compared with the PHA response observed in lymphocyte cultures from normal individuals. In one-way mixed lymphocyte culture experiments a significant decrease in responding capacity of the patients' lymphocytes to lymphocytes from normal donors could be demonstrated. In contrast, the stimulatory capacity of the patients' lymphocytes was found to be intact, or only slightly reduced.",
    "output": "In the one-way mixed lymphocyte culture experiments, the patients' lymphocytes demonstrated a significant decrease in their stimulatory capacity towards lymphocytes from normal donors. However, their stimulatory capacity towards self was found to be intact, or only slightly reduced.

In the micellar solutions the apparent rate of the H+-catalyzed degradation was increased twofold but that of water- and OH minus-catalyzed hydrolysis was decreased two- to three-fold. Consequently, the pH-rate profile of the micellar solutions was shifted to higher pH values and the pH of minimum degradation was found to be at 7.0 compared to 6.5 for the nonmicellar solution of the same ionic strength. Compared at their respective pH-rate profile minima, micellar penicillin G is 2.5 times as stable as the nonmicellar solution under the conditions of constant pH and ionic strength.",
    "output": "The pH of minimum degradation for the nonmicellar solution of the same ionic strength is 6.5, as mentioned in the context. However, it's important to note that the pH of minimum degradation for the micellar solution is 7.0, which is higher than that of the nonmicellar solution. This indicates that the micellar solution is more stable at higher pH values compared to the nonmicellar solution under the conditions of constant pH and ionic strength."

    "input": "The abdominal skin of juvenile white mice was used. Topical application was accomplished by intracutaneous injection. The solutions tested were thoroughly standardized. By using a special buffer system, a mixture of histidine glutamate and lysine glutamate, each pH value could be tested with the same buffer capacity. The pH values varied from pH 3 to pH 11, the solutions being always iso-osmolalic with plasma. Two criteria were used to judge the irritancy: (a) the edematous reaction for the first 6 h and (b) the macroscopic aspect after 24 h. A very special procedure enabled us to obtain objective numerical values for criterion (a). The results disclose that irritation becomes manifest at pH 4 and pH 10, becomes clear-cut with pH 3 and even more so with pH 11, and depends strongly on the buffer capacity employed. With two substances-amidosulfuric acid and (tri) sodium phosphate--it was exemplified how the procedure could be used to routinely screen for topical irritancy in an informative, inexpensive and decent manner.",
    "output": "The two criteria used to judge the irritancy of the solutions tested on the abdominal skin of juvenile white mice were:\n\n1. The edematous reaction for the first 6 hours. This refers to the swelling or inflammation caused by the solution. A more pronounced swelling would indicate a higher level of irritation.\n\n2. The macroscopic aspect after 24 hours. This refers to the overall appearance of the skin after a day. A change in color, texture, or other visible signs could indicate irritation.\n\nThe results suggest that irritation becomes manifest at pH 4 and pH 10, and becomes clearer with more extreme pH values (pH 3 and pH 11). The buffer capacity employed also strongly affects the level of irritation."

    "input": "A surgical preparation that allows chemical alteration of the blood supplied to specific area of the intact heart was used to investigate the effects of lowered tissue pH on the fine structure of myocardial cells. Controlled infusion of isotonic saline acidified with HCl to a pH value between 1.0 and 2.0 produced a lowering of blood pH to values of less than 7.0. This drop in the pH of the perfusing blood resulted in a corresponding decrease in pH of the relevant area of myocardium. When this decrease occurred without a concomitant increase in tissue lactate level, the myocardial cells of the acid-perfused area showed focal glycogen depletion, moderate relaxation of myofibrils and clumping of nuclear chromatin, and mild mitochondrial change, which did not include marked swelling although intramitochondrial electron-dense inclusions were often detectable. When the fall in pH was accompanied by a large increase in lactate concentration, however, the cells showed more severe glycogen depletion and clumping of nuclear chromatin, and mitochondrial change, which did include marked swelling, together with the presence of well developed inclusions.",

The relation between pH and P50 was a linear correlation for washed red blood cells by all three methods whereas the relation between pH and P50 was a log correlation for red blood cells in plasma. Multiple units of red blood cells with low 2,3 diphosphoglycerate (2,3 DPG) and increased affinity for oxygen, with normal 2,3 DPG and normal affinity for oxygen, and above normal 2,3 DPG and decreased affinity for oxygen, were frozen in 10 ml aliquots with 40% w/v glycerol and maintained at -80 degrees C.

For the first two compounds, steady state constants were independent of film thickness and solute concentration but increased linearly and sharply with PEG content and were reproducible. The films were impermeable to NaOH and permeation rates were independent of receiver compartment pH. Solubility coefficients and diffusion coefficients of the substances in the films were measured using sorption and/or time lag methods and were low as compared with polyethylene films. High solubility seemed to be associated with the presence of a free activated hydrogen, shown by sorption studies on other substances. From the evidence, it appeared that mass transfer was controlled by the solubility diffusion process in the ethyl cellulose of the membranes with all three substances. Enhancement of permeability by PEG thus seemed due to increased porosity, equivalent to reduction in the effective thickness of the matrix, which nevertheless retained its barrier properties. Enhancement coefficients calculated from the slopes of PEG concentration plots may be useful for predicting the increased mass transfer of drugs through such membranes and could enable the porosity and thickness factors to be balanced against each other for formulation of coated products.",

Mixtures of water and organic solvents (acetonitrile, dioxan, methanol and n-propanol) have been used. The choice of the organic solvent does not strongly influence the separation pattern.

At the lower pH, acetic acid was absorbed well absorbed and the colon absorbed fluid. The secretory effect could not be reproduced by hydrochloric acid solutions at pH 2.9. Fluid secretion induced by acetic acid was associated with discharge of mucus from goblet cells. The interference of colonic absorption by acetic acid might be important in some diarrheal diseases.",

    "input": "In vitro lymphocyte stimulation by mitomycin-C-blocked tumor cells has been used to demonstrate tumor-specific antigens in syngeneic murine systems and to follow the evolution of tumor immunity with the tumor-bearing state. Mitomycin-blocked tumor cells stimulated syngeneic lymphocytes from normal mice, from those bearing small tumors (less than 1 cm in diameter) and from tumor-immune mice, sensitized by tumor-cell inoculation and subsequent tumor removal, to undergo increased DNA synthesis as measured by the incorporation of tritiated thymidine. However, lymph-node cells from mice bearing tumors over 1 cm in diameter appeared to be maximally stimulated in vivo and incapable of further stimulation by the same tumor cells in vitro. This was reflected by the progressively increasing background levels of nucleic acid synthesis with the length of tumor-bearing and the size of the tumor. Although lymph-node cells from mice with large tumors did not respond to the same tumor cells in vitro, they did have normal responses to PHA. Within 7-14 days of surgical removal of the tumor, specific lymphocyte responsiveness and background activity returned to previous normal levels, but reinoculation with 10-6 tumor cells resulted in progressive tumor growth and loss of specific  in vitro responsiveness when the second tumor had reached the critical size of 1 cm in diameter. Brief exposure of tumor-immune lymph-node cells to a soluble antigen extract of the same tumor resulted in a marked increase in DNA synthetic activity compared to that obtained after exposure to a different tumor extract, muscle extract or medium alone underwent stimulation when cultured with mitomycin-blocked tumor cells. However, normally responsive tumor-immune lymph-node cells, after brief exposure to a soluble antigen extract of the same tumor, initially underwent increased DNA synthesis, but were incapable of further stimulation by mitomycin-blocked tumor cells. Tumor antigen, alone or complexed with antibody, was also demonstrated in the sera of mice bearing large tumors and is thought to be responsible for the refractoriness of lymph-node cells from these mice to further stimulation in vitro. These experiments demonstrate that tumor size and the consequent antigen load to which the tumor-bearing animals is subjected have a profound effect on tumor-specific lymphocyte responsiveness.",
    "output": "After surgical removal of the tumor, the specific lymphocyte responsiveness of mice initially returned to previous normal levels. However, upon reinoculation with 10-6 tumor cells, when the second tumor reached 1 cm in diameter, the lymphocyte responsiveness became lost again. This suggests that the lymphocyte responsiveness is influenced by the size of the tumor and the antigen load it presents. The larger the tumor, the less responsive the lymphocytes become to the same tumor cells in vitro, possibly due to the presence of tumor antigen in the serum of mice bearing large tumors."

At an effector cell to tumor cell ratio of 10:1,, nucleated spleen cells from mice bearing the tumor for 6 days enhanced tumor cell growth. Neither lymph node nor thymus cells from tumor-bearing mice were stimulatory. Tumor cell growth was inhibited by either spleen or lymph node cells only when a ratio of 1000:1 was exceeded. Thymocytes, however, were inhibitory at a ratio of 100:1,. Lymphoid cells from normal mice were not stimulatory at low ratios or inhibitory at any ratio tested. Both stimulatory and inhibitory activities disappeared by Day 20. Filtration of sensitized spleen cells through a glass wool column did not remove stimulatory or inhibitory activities. Subsequent passage through a nylon wool column resulted in a loss of stimulation, but not inhibition, of tumor cell growth. Stimulatory activity was completely abrogated by treatment with either anti-theta or rabbit anti-mouse gamma-globulin serum. A 1:1 mixture of spleen cells treated with either antisera did not restore stimulation. Spleen cells from T-cell- or B-cell-deficient mice bearing the tumor for 6 days were also not stimulatory.

    "input": "Tumor-specific immunity mediated by thymus-derived lymphocytes (T cells) was established in C3H/He mice against syngeneic X5563 plasmacytoma. Splenic T cells from mice, which exhibited resistance to tumor challenge, revealed a potent in vivo tumor-neutralizing activity as well as in vitro cytotoxicity. In contrast, spleen cells from mice 7 days after tumor cell inoculation (7-day tumor-bearing mice) exhibited no protective activity when assayed by in vivo tumor-neutralization test, whereas these cells exhibited almost comparable in vitro cytotoxic activity to that from the tumor-resistant mice. Any suppressor cell activity was not detected in 7-day tumor-bearing animals. While a slight in vivo protective activity was observed in the spleen cells from 14-day tumor-bearing mice, this activity was still significantly weaker than that of spleen cells from mice similarly inoculated with tumor 14 days before but whose tumor had been removed 7 days before the assay. The development of in vivo protective immunity in tumor-resected mice was suppressed by intravenous inoculation with 7000 R X-irradiated tumor cells. These results indicate that in vitro reactivity of immune T lymphocyte population is not always correlated with in vivo protective immunity, but there is a substantial decrease in in vivo immune capability of T cells from tumor-bearing animals, and that this suppression may be ascribed to the presence of a large amount of tumor-associated transplantation antigens rather than to suppressor cell activity.",
    "output": "The result of in vivo protective activity in spleen cells from 14-day tumor-bearing mice was significantly weaker compared to those from tumor-resected mice.

Tumor cells used for immunization were first treated to alter the lipid content, then irradiated and injected intraperitoneally into syngeneic mice. A second identical immunization was performed 14 days later. The degree of immunization in the treated mice was assessed by survival time after challenge with untreated viable tumor cells of the same origin as the immunizing cells. For all tumors tested, enrichment of the immunizing cells with cholesterol or cholesteryl hemisuccinate, which increased the membrane-lipid microviscosity significantly, afforded a marked increase in immunization, compared to that obtained with cells that were only irradiated. Furthermore, in over 90% of the mice that were pretreated with cholesteryl hemisuccinate-enriched cells, tumor growth after the challenge was not detectable. Because the lipid-modifying treatments of the immunizing cells involve no toxic substances, these results may provide the basis for a potent approach to immunotherapy of human cancer.",
    "output": "The degree of immunization in the treated mice was assessed by measuring the survival time after challenge with untreated viable tumor cells of the same origin as the immunizing cells. If the survival time was longer, it indicated a higher degree of immunization. The method used here is based on the observation that mice with a higher degree of immunization would survive longer after being challenged with the same tumor cells."

    "input": "The effect of intradermal immunisation with viable line 1 hepatoma cells and BCG was studied in syngeneic strain 2 guinea pigs. Immunisation with 1.5 X 10(6) hepatoma cells admixed to 200 microgram BCG induced tumor regression in 7/8 animals. Higher or lower doses were less effective and sometimes led to enhanced tumor growth. It appeared that regression or progression of tumors is established as early as 3 weeks after tumor inoculation. Aspects of humoral and cell-mediated tumor immunity in immunised and/or tumor-bearing animals were studied in vitro by the use of mixed cell cultures and of cytotoxicity tests. Immunised tumor-bearing animals reacted more vigorously than those from non-immunised animals when the tumor was small. With increasing tumor volume the specific tumor immunity disappeared in both immunised and non-immunised animals. Sera obtained from immunised or regressor animals were cytotoxic and partially blocked the mixed cell interaction. Sera obtained from progressor animals were neither cytotoxic and nor did they block the mixed cell interaction. Cytotoxic activities resided within immunoglobulin fractions enriched in IgG1 or IgG2, whereas blocking activity was mainly associated with IgG2. The effector cell function was not inhibited by the immunoglobulin fractions tested. In the discussion it is suggested that the ratio of IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies elicited during immune treatment may critically influence the success or failure of immunotherapy.",

The specific tumor immunity was more pronounced in immunized animals when the tumor was small, but it disappeared in both immunized and non-immunized animals as the tumor volume increased.

    "input": "Cell-mediated immune reactions against carcinogen-induced rat tumours were demonstrated by the in vitro microcytotoxicity test. Lymph-node cells from syngeneic rats immunized against individual aminoazo-dye-induced hepatomas or 3-methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas were cytotoxic for cells of the immunizing tumour compared with the effects of normal lymph-node cells. Only a low level of cross-reactivity was detectable against target cells derived from otherr tumours. Conversely, lymph-node cells from tumour -bearing rats were cross-reactive against a range of tumour cells, suggesting that the tumour-bearer was sensitized against a common antigen(s) as well as the individually specific antigen associated with these tumours. Lymph-node cells were reactive at an early time (from day 2) after tumour implantation and their cytotoxic potential persisted until terminal stages of tumour growth. Spleen cells from tumour-bearer and tumour-immune donors also exhibited comparable cytotoxic reactivities of the same specificity as that shown by lymph-node cell preparations. These findings are discussed in relation to the development of cell-mediated immune responses in the tumour-bearing rat and in immunized rats which are capable of rejecting transplanted tumour cells.",
    "output": "In the context provided, both lymph-node cells from tumour-bearers and lymph-node cells from tumour-immune donors exhibited comparable cytotoxic reactivities. This means that cells from rats that have a tumour and cells from rats that have been immunized against a tumour can both be cytotoxic (harmful) towards cells from the immunizing tumour. However, they show a low level of cross-reactivity against target cells derived from other tumours. Spleen cells from both tumour-bearer and tumour-immune donors also demonstrated the same cytotoxic reactivities as lymph-node cell preparations."

    "instruction": "What type of cells mediated the natural killer activity found in most young mice?",
    "input": "Cell-mediated immune reactions appear to play an important role in resistance against growth of leukemia cells in mice. Possible mechanisms for in vivo protection in two tumor systems are discussed. These tumor models, which are a Friend leukemia virus-induced transplantable tumor, FBL-3, and primary murine sarcoma virus (MSV) -induced tumors, are strongly antigenic; under some conditions, tumors regress completely. In mice with regressing FBL-3 tumors, cell-mediated cytotoxicity was measured by release of [125I]iododeoxyuridine. The response was biphasic, with an initial peak at 10 days and a 2nd peak after 30 days. A boost in reactivity could be elicited by later challenge with tumor cells. All of the reactivity was dependent on T-cells, being eliminated by treatment with anti-theta plus complement. The specificity of the reactions was not completely defined, but it was consistent with Friend type-specific antigen plus broader, common antigens. In mice with regressing MSV tumors, strong cell-mediated cytotoxicity, measured mainly by release of 51Cr, was seen against RBL-5, a Rauscher virus-induced leukemia. A single peak of response occurred at about 14 days after virus inoculation. Upon later challenge with RBL-5 cells, a vigorous and rapid secondary response was elicited, mainly in the region of tumor challenge. This cytotoxic reactivity and in vivo resistance to leukemia.lso was completely dependent on T-cells. In addition, macrophage-mediated inhibition of leukemia cell growth in vitro was seen in this system at the time of peak tumor development. The 51Cr release cytotoxicity was specific and directed primarily against an antigen, MEV-SA1, associated with mouse endogenous C-type viruses. The macrophage-induced growth inhibition appeared to be nonspecific. In both the FBL-3 and MSV tumor systems, protection against tumor growth could be adoptively transferred by immune lymphoid cells. In addition to induction of cell-mediated immunity by tumor cell or virus inoculation, cell-mediated cytotoxic reactivity was found to occur naturally in most young mice. This natural killer activity was quite distinct from the experimentally elicited reactions, being mediated by N-cells, a subpopulation of lymphoid cells with no clearly identifiable cell surface markers. The natural cytotoxicity was also directed against antigenic specificities different from those recognized by the MSV-immune cells. The central issue in all of these studies has been to determine the relationships between the in vitro-detected cell-mediated reactivity and in vivo resistance to leukemia.",

    "input": "In experimental cardiac hypertrophy induced by aortic constriction of rats, the hypertrophy was established after 5-7 days. The basic biochemical changes for increasing tissue mass; increases in protein, nucleic acid, and polyamine synthesis started to occur between 2 and 8 hours followed by an increase in uridine nucleotide pools via predominance of \"salvage\" pathway. Although the precise coupling mechanism between mechanical stress and biochemical changes is still obscure, an interval between increased load and DNA transcription may be quite short. Some of the key enzymes regulating these processes showed a biphasic response the reason of which is not clear. The established hypertrophied heart muscle showed a decrease in velocity of isotonic shortening and an increase in resting tension. The former alteration is referred to a decrease in myosin ATPase activity and an disorder in excitation-contraction coupling mechanism, and the latter is supposed to be due to an increase in collagen in heart muscle.",
    "output": "The increase in resting tension in the established hypertrophied heart muscle is supposed to be due to an increase in collagen in heart muscle.

Exercised animals maintained normal growth rate, and cardiac hypertrophy was not present. Left ventricular RNA, DNA, and cytochrome c levels were unchanged. Heart functional measurements obtained in situ were similar in sedentary and exercised animals under control conditions. When subjected to sustained (1-3 days) aortic constriction pressure overload, exercised animals maintained or increased myocardial contractility. Contractility was depressed in sedentary animals. Both sedentary and exercised animals increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure without changing contractility during acute (1-3 min) pressure overload. However, exercised animals were able to fully regain normal cardiac output when the acute overload was relieved. Cardiac output remained approximately 10% below control in sedentary animals. The improved ability of previously exercised animals to withstand pressure overload appears to be due to alterations in adaptation rather than preliminary augmentation of metabolism or function.",
    "output": "After acute pressure overload was relieved, the cardiac output in sedentary animals did not return to normal levels, remaining approximately 10% below control. In contrast, exercised animals were able to fully regain normal cardiac output when the acute overload was relieved. This suggests that previous exercise may improve the ability of the heart to withstand pressure overload, possibly due to adaptation changes rather than preliminary augmentation of metabolism or function."

    "input": "In rats the hypokinetic state obtained by restraint in special cages, produces after 30 days, a marked decrease in Na+ and K+ dependent ATP-ase in the skeletal muscle. After 15 days hypokinesia the enzymatic content of the investigated tissues did not change. In the left cardiac ventricular muscle Na+ and K+ dependent ATP-ase decreased after 15 days and particularly after 30 days hypokinesia. These changes were brought about by the hypofunctional state of both muscles, which also produced structural alterations. In the skeletal and cardiac muscles electron microscopy revealed fibrillar atrophy and mitochondrial alterations typical of an affected function. In the cardiac muscle, in which these changes were more accentuated, the dissociation of the intercalar disc was also noted, aspects partially described by others.",
    "output": "After 30 days of hypokinesia in rats, the left cardiac ventricular muscle shows a significant decrease in Na+ and K+ dependent ATP-ase. This decrease is accompanied by structural alterations, such as fibrillar atrophy and mitochondrial changes, which are indicative of an affected function. Additionally, the dissociation of the intercalar disc was observed in the cardiac muscle, a change that is partially described in the context. These changes suggest that prolonged hypokinesia can lead to functional and structural impairments in the left cardiac ventricular muscle."

Possible contributing factors in this improvement are increased coronary reserve and capacity to deliver oxygen to the myocardium, increased myocardial glycogen stores and increased turnover of fatty acids through the endogenous triglyceride pool. Myocardial oxidative compounds and high energy phosphate stores are not altered. Major changes are found in the energy utilization pathways. Actomyosin, myosin, and heavy meromyosin ATPase activity and binding activity of isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum are all enhanced. Sulfhydryl control of the active site of myosin ATPase is altered. The biochemical effects of conditioning are short lived when training is decreased or discontinued.",
    "output": "When training is decreased or discontinued, the biochemical effects of conditioning in the heart begin to gradually reverse. The improvements in mechanical responses, such as increased coronary reserve and oxygen delivery, reduced fatty acid turnover, and enhanced energy utilization pathways (like Actomyosin, myosin, and heavy meromyosin ATPase activity, and binding activity of isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum) start to diminish. The alterations in sulfhydryl control of the active site of myosin ATPase also begin to revert. However, the levels of myocardial oxidative compounds and high energy phosphate stores remain unchanged. The rate at which these changes occur may vary depending on the individual and the duration of training.

    "input": "Enzyme activities were measured in homogenates of left and right ventricles of guinea pigs after 14 and 28 days' exposure to 400 mmHg barometric pressure. All animals developed anorexia and right ventricular hypertrophy. Two control groups of animals were used, one free fed and the other restricted to the amount of food chosen by the hypobaric group. The factorial design of the experiment allowed some distinction between the effects of anorexia, hypertrophy, and hypoxia. Dietary restriction was associated with a decrease in glycogen phosphorylase, hexokinase, and succinate dehydrogenase activity and an increase in the M-subunits of lactate dehydrogenase. Myocardial hypertrophy was associated with an increase in the activity of the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway down as far as phosphoglycerate kinase and an increase in the M-subunits of lactate dehydrogenase. Chronic hypoxia seemed specifically to be associated with an increase in the H-subunits of lactate dehydrogenase and possibly a slight transient increase in succinate dehydrogenase activity. Mixing studies indicated that changes in enzyme activities were likely to be due to changes in enzyme concentrations.",
    "output": "Dietary restriction in the guinea pigs, as shown in the study, was associated with a decrease in the activity of glycogen phosphorylase, along with hexokinase and succinate dehydrogenase. This suggests that dietary restriction may influence the metabolic pathways in the heart, potentially affecting energy production and storage mechanisms. However, it's important to note that these effects were observed in the context of anorexia and right ventricular hypertrophy, which were also present in the study. The exact mechanisms and specific contributions of each factor (anorexia, hypertrophy, and hypoxia) to the changes in enzyme activities are not explicitly stated in the context provided."

During the same period, a significant increase in the concentration of contractile proteins was noticeable, whereas the content of nonprotein substances and of water corresponded to the control values. The hydroxyproline concentration, as a measure of the collagen tissue content, increased only after 24 weeks. The time course of the specific ATPase activity was closely parallel to the decrease in the unloaded myocardial shortening velocity, as estimated at the same stage by our group. This is in accordance with the assumption of a fundamental relationship between the two values. The reduced rate of energy turnover and of the shortening velocity is regarded as an adaptive mechanism which, however, has a negative effect in advanced hypertrophy when further diminution takes place. The decrease in the specific enzymatic activity of actomysin is not necessarily linked to a large increase in myocardial mass, but is already apparent at moderate degrees of hypertrophy (34%).",

At the end of the training period a group of exercised and sedentary rats was subjected to hemodynamic evaluation under general anesthesia. Except for a slight elevation in the heart rates of the exercised animals there were no significant differences between the exercised and sedentary rats at rest. Following an increase in afterload or a period of hypoxia, the cardiac index of the exercised animals remained significantly higher than that of the sedentary controls. These differences were related to changes in stroke volume. Another group of exercised and sedentary animals underwent either constriction of the ascending aorta or a sham operation. Sedentary rats developed significant hypertrophy at 3 days but had no hypertrophy at 1 day after aortic constriction. Exercised rats, however, developed significant myocardial hypertrophy by 1 day after pressure overload. These data suggest that the heart from an exercised animal is better able to tolerate increases in afterload and hypoxia and can respond with compensatory myocardial hypertrophy more rapidly than the heart of a sedentary animal.",

After 11 wk of progressive treadmill exercise (1 h/day), gastrocnemius cytochrome c oxidase activity was 38% higher (P less than 0.01) in the trained (n = 20) as compared to control (n = 20) rats. Cardiac Mg2+-stimulated myofibril ATPase activity (0.308 +/- 0.012 vs. 0.324 +/- 0.006 micrometer.mg-1.min-1) did not change nor was there any change in myofibril protein concentration (60.0 +/- 1.12 vs. 59.9 +/- 0.85 mg.g-1). The isolated left ventricular papillary muscle showed no significant change in time-to-peak tension (TPT) or half-relaxation time. Tension output, however, was significantly increased with training, 2.2 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.1 g.mm-2 (P less than 0.025). Furthermore, when the papillary preparations were perfused with 0.5 mM lanthanum (La3+) to displace membrane-bound Ca2+, the time course for tension decay was significantly prolonged in the trained muscles (P less than 0.001). We conclude that endurance running of this type does not necessarily increase myofibril ATPase activity or the time course of the isometric twitch of rat papillary muscle. However, tension output per unit area does increase and this appears to be due to a greater amount of Ca2+ being made available to the contractile apparatus.",

    "input": "The isolated perfused working rat heart preparation has been used to study the effects of respiratory acidosis on myocardial metabolism and contractilly. Hearts were perfused with 5 mM glucose and 10(-2) U/ml of insulin in order to enhance metabolsim of glucose relative to that of fatty acids. After perfusion with Krebs bicarbonate medium at pH 6.6, hearts rapidly ceased performing external work and peak left ventricular pressure fell by 75% after 5 minutes. Oxygen consumption, rate of ATP generation and overall glycolytic flux also declined rapidly. After about 2 minutes of perfusion, the fall of glycolytic flux showed a partial reversal, which was largely accounted for by increased lactate production, so that glucose oxidation decreased further. The reversal of glycoltic flux could be accounted for by partial release of H+ inhibition of phospho-fructokinase by increased tissue levels of adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and P1 and decreased levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine phosphate. The increased proportion of glucose uptake converted to lactate together with an increase of the tissue lactate/pyruvate ratio could be accounted for by inhibition of the malate-aspartate cycle combined with tissue hypoxia. Lactate accumulated in the tissue as a result of a decreased permeability of the plasma membrane to lactate. Decreased oxygen delivery to the myocardium was caused by secondary constriction of the coronary vessels. In further experiments, the coronary flow was regulated by an external pump which delivered fluid at a controlled rate into the aortic cannula above the coronary arteries, and the degree of tissue hypoxia was monitored by measuring changes of pyridine nucleotide reduction state by surface fluorescence techniques. The effects of acidosis uncomplicated by possible hypoxia were compared directly with those produced by ischemic hypoxia. The effects of acidosis under these conditions were similar to those described above, and to those produced by ischemia. From these and other data it is concluded that the effects of ischemia are caused by a lowering of the intracellular pH, which decreases the rate of energy production relative to the rate of energy demand. However, it is suggested that the primary cause of the decreased peak systolic pressure with either acidosis or ischemia is not a result of a defect of energy metabolism, but is due to alteration of the calcium cycle of the heart. Possible causes of irreversible heart failure after prolonged ischemia are discussed.",

Heavy meromyosin (HMM) from conditioned hearts had a higher Ca++-ATPase activity than from controls. Fluorescence with 8-anilinonaphthalene sulfonate (ANS) was increased 30 percent in HMM from conditioned hearts. The results suggest that the increased myosin ATPase activity in the hearts of exercised animals may be due to a local conformational change at or near the active site.",

The N-terminal amino acid sequence of CN2 shared a limited sequence homology with an internal portion of a second 5-S RNA binding protein from E. coli, EL5, and, based also on the molecular weights of the proteins and studies on the protein binding sites in 5-S RNAs, a model for the evolution of the eukaryotic 5-S RNA binding protein is suggested in which a fusion of the prokaryotic sequences may have occurred. Unlike the native 5-S RNA . protein complex, a variety of RNAs interacted with the smaller CN2 fragment to form homogeneous ribonucleoprotein complexes; the results suggest that the CN1 fragment may confer specificity on the natural 5-S RNA-protein interaction.",

The involvement of the two polynucleotide binding sites of S1 protein (site I binding single-stranded DNA or RNA, and site II binding single-stranded RNA only) in the S1--ribosomal interaction have been examined by competition experiments with polynucleotides of known affinity for the two sites. We find that site I does not contribute to the interaction; site II binding appears to provide a major part of the binding free energy, presumably by interaction of S1 with the 16S rRNA of the 30S particle. The remaining binding free energy is probably derived from the interaction of S1 protein with other proteins of the 30S subunit. The affinity of S1 for 70S ribosomes is about the same as that for the 30S subunit; the affinity of S1 for 50S subunits is much less. Binding affinities and stoichiometries of S1 protein with \"inactive\" 30S ribosomal subunits have also been examined.",

    "input": "When Escherichia coli 30-S ribosomal subunits are hydrolysed under mild conditions, two ribonucleoprotein fragments of unequal size are produced. Knowledge of the RNA sequences contained in these hydrolysis products was required for the experiments described in the preceding paper, and the RNA sub-fragments have therefore been examined by oligonucleotide analysis. Two well-defined small fragments of free RNA, produced concomitantly with the ribonucleoprotein fragments, were also analysed. The larger ribonucleoprotein fragment, containing predominantly proteins S4, S5, S8, S15, S16 (17) and S20, contains a complex mixture of RNA sub-fragments varying from about 100 to 800 nucleotides in length. All these fragments arose from the 5'-terminal 900 nucleotides of 16-S RNA, corresponding to the well-known 12-S fragment. No long-range interactions could be detected within this RNA region in these experiments. The RNA from the smaller ribonucleoprotein fragment (containing proteins S7, S9 S10, S14 and S19) has been described in detail previously, and consists of about 450 nucleotides near the 3' end of the 16-S RNA, but lacking the 3'-terminal 150 nucleotides. The two small free RNA fragments (above) partly account for these missing 150 nucleotides; both fragments arose from section A of the 16-S RNA, but section J (the 3'-terminal 50 nucleotides) was not found. This result suggests that the 3' region of 16-S RNA is not involved in stable interactions with protein.",

A ribonucleoprotein complex was isolated which contained the two proteins and three noncontiguous RNA subfragments totaling 93 nucleotides, that could be unambiguously located in the 16 S RNA sequence. We present a secondary structural model for the RNA moiety of the binding site complex, in which the two smaller fragments are extensively base-paired, respectively, to the two halves of the large fragment, to form two disconnected duplexes. Each of the two duplexes is interrupted by a small internal loop. This model is supported by (i) minimum energy considerations, (ii) sites of cleavage by ribonuclease A, and (iii) modification by the single strand-specific reagent kethoxal. The effect of protein binding on the topography of the complex is reflected in the kethoxal reactivity of the RNA moiety.

The enzyme is a glycoprotein containing, by weight: 0.9% galactose; 1.9% mannose, 1.9% N-acetylglucosamine and 1.9% N-acetylneuraminic acid. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate separated proteins with molecular weights ot 55 000, 51 400 and 25 000. Resolution of the two larger protein bands varied with the gel system and these proteins may differ only in carbohydrate content. Gel filtration of te purified enzyme failed to separate the three proteins. Treatments with the cross-linking reagent dimethyl suberimidate prior to electrophoresis, resulted in a diminution of the original protein bands and the formation of oligomers with molecular weights of 80 000, 100 000, 130 000, and 144 000. These results suggest that the heavy (55 000 and 51 400) and light (25 000) proteins are structurally associated. The molecular weight of the native enzyme, measured by gel filtration, was dependent on the pH of the eluting buffer. At pH 5.0 or 6.0 a catalytically active peak was observed, with a molecular weight of 305 000. At pH 7.5 this peak was completely absent and the enzyme eluted as an asymmetrical peak with an apparent molecular weight of about 60 000. The reduction in apparent molecular weight at pH 7.5 was reversible by dialysis of isolated fractions at pH 6.0. In agreement with these findings the sedimentation coefficient was 8.5 S at pH 5.0 but only 3.6 S at pH 7.5.

By these procedures, the enzyme was purified about 800-fold with an activity recovery of 9%, and the preparation was electrophoretically homogenous. The enzyme was most active and stable at pH 7-8.

The enzyme had a native molecular weight of 180,000 +/- 10,000 (by calibrated gel filtration and gel electrophoresis) and a subunit molecular weight of 90,000 +/- 5,000 (by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis).

All the radioactivity was removed by procedures that removed pyridoxal phosphate. Thus, the enzyme could not be classified as an a type (phosphorylated, active in the absence of a cofactor) or as a b type (non-phosphorylated, inactive in the absence of a cofactor). The level of phosphorylase was markedly increased in mycelium taken from older cultures in which the carbon source (glucose or sucrose) had been depleted. The polyethylene glycol fractionation scheme applied at pH 7.5 to mycelial extracts of younger cultures (taken before depletion of the sugar) resulted in co-purification of glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthetase.",

(ii) After two consecutive isopycnic potassium tartrate gradient centrifugations (20 to 50%), coinciding peaks of plaque titer, protein, and radioactivity were found at a density of from 1.20 to 1.21 g/cm3. To characterize the structural polypeptides of human cytomegalovirus and to establish relative purification criteria, virus was purified from two mixtures: (i) [35S]methionine-labeled extracellular virus mixed with an equal volume of unlabeled normal culture fluid; (ii) unlabeled extracellular virus mixed with an equal volume of [357a1methionine-labeled normal culture fluid. The extent of purification, as judged by the ratio of cellular to viral radioactivity, was 39-fold; i.e. about 2.5% of the protein in the purified virus preparation could be accounted for by host protein contamination. Electrophoresis of purified [35S]methionine-labeled virus on a polyacrylamide gel slab showed that there were at least 33 viral structural polypeptides (VPs), and their molecular weights ranged from 11,000 to 290,000. Autoradiograms obtained from electropherograms of purified [14C]glucosamine labeled virus showed six bands. Four of these were so broad that several VPs corresponded to each of the glycosylated bands. When heavy (two fractions close to 1.21 g/cm3) and light (two fractions close to 1.20 g/cm3) fractions of the PFU peak from the second potassium tartrate gradient were analyzed separately, the number of polypeptides observed was the same, but the relative amounts of some polypeptides differed. The major polypeptide, VP17, was found in greater amounts in the heavy fraction (35%) than in the light fraction (22%). The amount of DNA as a percentage of the weight of protein was 2% for the light fraction and 1% for the heavy fraction.",

Virus RNA was associated with a subviral particle which had a sedimentation coefficient of 650S, compared with 495S for the intact virion, and which banded in Cs2SO4 gradients at 1-295 g/ml. Negatively stained preparations of subviral particles were shown by electron microscopy to contain spherical particles of 60 to 70 nm diam., similar in appearance to those derived from oncornaviruses. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the polypeptides from isolated subviral particles showed that these structures contained three of the four major virus structural proteins, the arginine-rich polypeptide VP2 and the two membrane glycopolypeptides VP2 and 4. The detergent-liberated surface projections, composed of a single species of sulphated glycopolypeptide, VPI, were isolated by rate-zonal centrifugation through sucrose gradients followed by precipitation with ammonium sulphate in the presence of bovine serum albumin.",

    "input": "Twenty-four pH monitoring the distal esophagus quantitates gastroesophageal reflux in a near physiologic setting by measuring the frequency and duration of acid exposure to the esophageal mucosa. Fifteen asymptomatic volunteers were studies with 24-hour pH and esophageal manometry. The normal cardia was more competent supine than in the upright position. Physiologic reflux was unaffected by age, rarely occurred during slumber, and was the rule after alimentation. One hundred symptomatic pateitns with an abnormal 24-hour pH record (2 S.D. above the mean of controls) could be divided into three patterns of pathological reflux: those who refluxed only in the upright position (9), only in the supine position (37), and in both positions (54). Upright differed from supine refluxers by excessive aerophagia causing reflux episodes by repetitive belching. Compared to controls, they had excessive post-prandial reflux, lower DES pressure, and less DES exposed to the positive pressure of the abdomen. Supine differed from upright refluxers by having a higher incidence of esophagitis and an inability to clear the esophagus of acid after a supine reflux episode. Compared to controls, they had only a lower DES pressure. Combined refluxers had a higher incidence of esophagitis than supine refluxers. Stricture (15%) was seen only in this group. They were similar to supine refluxers in their inability to clear a supine reflux episode. Compared to controls, they had a lower DES pressure and less DES exposed to the positive pressure of the abdomen. Forty of the 100 patients had an antireflux procedure (4 upright, 8 supine, 28 combined). The most severe postoperative flatus and abdominal distention was seen in the upright refluxers. It is concluded that minimal reflux is physiological. Patients with pathological reflux all have lower DES pressure. Patients with upright reflux have less of their DES exposed to the positive pressure environment of the abdomen. Patients with supine reflux have an inability to clear the esophagus of reflux acid and are prone to develop esophagitis. Patients with both upright and supine reflux have the most severe disease and are at risk in developing strictures. In patients with only upright reflux, aerophagia and delayed gastric emptying may be an important etiological factor.",

    "input": "The incidence of aspiration, the causative esophageal pathophysiology, and the results of surgical therapy were evaluated in 100 patients with abnormal gastroesophageal reflux documented by 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring. Based on historical evidence, 48 patients were suspected to be aspirators. Eight patients had documented episodes of aspiration (drop on esophagela pH, followed by acid taste in mouth and onset of cough or wheezing spell) during the monitoring period. Nine patients were considered to be potential aspirators because they presented oral acid regurgitation without development of pulmonary symptoms. In five patients a primary respiratory disorder (PRD) induced gastroesophageal reflux. The remaining 78 patients had abnormal reflux without aspiartion or regurgitation. Aspirators had a 75% incidence of esophageal motor abnormality on manometry, and the clearance of refluxed acid was significantly delayed in the supine position. A history of heartburn and endoscopic evidence of esophagitis were present in only half of the patients who were documented aspirators. Potential aspirators were spared from aspiration by rapid esophageal clearance of refluxed acid unaffected by changes in body position. Patients with a PRD had higher distal esophageal segment (DES) pressure and normal esophageal motility with minimal esophagitis. Nonaspirators significantly improved their clearance while in the supine position, emphasizing the protective effect of esophageal peristalsis against aspiration. An antireflux procedure in five aspirators raised the DES pressure significantly and returned the reflux status to normal by 24-hour pH-monitoring standards. The incidence of aspiration appears to be less than that suspected by history and is due to a motor disorder that interferes with the ability of the esophagus to clear reflex acid. Abnormal pulmonary symptoms can induce or result from gastroesophageal reflux and, when the latter occurs, an antireflex procedure stops both reflux and aspiration.",

The patients without severe reflux complications were operated upon mainly with a modified Husfeldt hernia repair and the patients with complications, such as oesophageal stricture and shortening, underwent various surgical procedures. The main reason for unsatisfactory clinical results, with persistent reflux symptoms, was gastro-oesophageal reflux uncorrected by the surgical procedure. However, gastro-oesophageal reflux was detected even in completely asymptomatic patients. It was found that the reflux symptoms were influenced by the oesophageal motility. The clinical results were better and recurrence of hernia and the occurrence of pathological reflux were lower in patients operated upon for hernia without severe reflux complications. Creation of a competent antireflux barrier between the oesophagus and stomach for control of gastro-oesophageal reflux is much more difficult in patients with severe reflux complications.",

To date 22 patients, six to 32 (average 15) years after repair of their esophageal atresias, have been evaluated by personal interview and esophageal manometrics and acid reflux testing. Previous barium swallow examinations had demonstrated varying degrees of anastomotic narrowing (12 patients), abnormal esophageal motor function (11 patients), gastroesophageal reflux (two patients), and hiatal hernia (one patient). Ten patients experience intermittent dysphagia for solid foods. Seven have typical symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux. Esophageal function tests including manometry and intraesophageal pH recording, have demonstrated varying abnormalities of esophageal motility in 21 patients and moderate to severe gastroesophageal reflux in 13. Two patients have required reconstruction of the esophagogastric junction for control of severe reflux esophagitis. The unexpected high incidence of gastroesophageal reflux in these patients, coupled with their abnormal esophageal motility which impairs normal acid clearing, renders them more prone to reflux esophagitis. Careful long-term evaluation for gastroesophageal reflux and its complications is indicated following primary repair of esophageal atresia. Evaluation of esophageal function with intraesophageal pressure and pH recordings is a far more sensitive indicator of esophageal physiology than the barium swallow examination.",

From these results it is supposed that the antiflux procedure only produces a pressure barrier but not a digestive sphincter. According to the pressure barrier in the functional analysis of the esophagus, three typical findings appeared: esophagitis (grade I), normal pH-monitoring, and delayed acid clearance.",

The injection of noradrenaline and adrenaline induced simultaneously a rapid depression of flow rate and an increase of perfusion pressure. Phenylephrine, indirect sympathomimetic drugs and dopamine did not change the perfusion pressure and the hydrelatic function (flow rate, secretion of chloride and total calcium). The protein and enzyme secretion was enhanced both in normal animals and cats pretreated by reserpine or 6-hydroxydopamine.

    "input": "Adrenergic agonists produced a characteristic and definite decrease in the amplitude of spontaneous contractions and tone of the isolated rabbit jejunum. Effect of phenylephrine was abolished either by phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine. Relaxation induced by epinephrine and by norepinephrine was inhibited after combined treatment with phentolamine and propranolol. Phentolamine alone diminished the response to epinephrine and to norepinephrine, but the diminution for epinephrine was greater, indicating that epinephrine has a greater affinity for alpha- than for beta-receptors in the rabbit jejunum. Stimulation of the beta-receptors by isoproterenol was inhibited by propranolol, oxprenolol, sotalol and pindolol, but the block was incomplete. The activity of these four beta-blockers in preventing the inhibitory response to isoproterenol was as follows: inidolol greater than or equal to oxprenolol greater than propranolol greater than sotalol. This demonstrates the fact that not all beta-adrenergic blocking agents possess an identical pharmacologic spectrum of activity. Also it can be suggested that the beta-receptors of jejunum differ in specificity from those of other organs.",
    "output": "In the context provided, phentolamine had a significant effect on the response to epinephrine in the isolated rabbit jejunum. Specifically, phentolamine diminished the response to epinephrine more than it did to norepinephrine, indicating that epinephrine has a greater affinity for alpha- than for beta-receptors in the rabbit jejunum. This suggests that phentolamine, being a non-selective alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonist, blocks both alpha and beta receptors, but epinephrine primarily interacts with the alpha-receptors in the jejunum, resulting in a more pronounced effect when phentolamine is present."

DOPA and dopamine reduced the spike and mechanical activities. The effects of dopamine were suppressed by treatment with phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine or propranolol. It seems that beta-response is predominant. Noradrenaline and adrenaline also blocked the spike generation and depressed the mechanical activity. Inhibitory actions caused by noradrenaline and adrenaline were blocked by adrenergic blockers. However, no significant effects of normetanephrine and metanephrine were detected. Dose-response curves for acetylcholine with and without dopamine, isoprenaline, phenylephrine and noradrenaline were obtained. The curves with adrenergic stimulants were shifted to higher concentrations of acetylcholine.

On the testicular half of the tissue all except isoprenaline enhanced twitches and/or caused contractions. These effects were blocked by alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists. On the urethral preparation all except phenylephrine, which often enhanced twitches, inhibited responses to field stimulation. These effects were not blocked by alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists or by propranolol, though the latter blocked inhibitory effects of isoprenaline on both segments. Inhibitory responses to tyramine persisted in urethral segments treated with cocaine and in urethral segments taken from reserpine-treated rats, and thus tyramine may have some direct action. No regional variation was observed in response to acetylcholine or carbachol.

The facilitatory effect of clonidine was antagonized in all groups by i.v. injection of the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, phentolamine (5 mg/kg) and piperoxan (1 mg/kg). In the control periods before clonidine, reflex bradycardia was similar in pretreated animals to that in animals without pretreatment. It was concluded therefore that catecholamines have no essential transmitter functions in the cardiodepressor reflex loop.

Effects due to intermediate doses were not affected, or were potentiated within about 30 min, following an initial inhibition. 2 The alpha-adrenoceptor blockers thus caused a shift to the right and an increase of the maximum height of log dose-response curves of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulants. For a given dose of antagonist, the onset was slower for the potentiating than for the blocking effect. 3 The shift to the right induced by piperoxan and yohimbine on dose-response curves of noradrenaline and adrenaline was analysed with the Schild plot, and the slopes obtained, around 0.3, were lower than expected from receptor theory. When cocaine was used to block neuronal uptake, the slopes were close to 1.0. 4 The increase in maximum response to noradrenaline and adrenaline induced by alpha-adrenoceptor blockers was dependent on the time of incubation, on the dose of antagonist, and on the initial height of responses to the agonist. A less pronounced potentiation was also obtained when acetylcholine was used as agonist. 5 The findings are explained in terms of receptor theory as being due to a dual effect of alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists; competitive antagonism proper, which may be disclosed after blockade of neuronal uptake, and an interaction at a different locus, which results in potentiation of the effects of noradrenaline and adrenaline.",

Atropine (3 x 10(-5) and 3 x 10(-4) M) enhanced the electrical-field-stimulation-induced outflow of tritium from the pulmonary artery preloaded with 3H-(-)-noradrenaline. In contrast, atropine in a concentration-dependent manner either had no effect or slightly decreased the tyramine-induced outflow of tritium. Atropine reduced the contractile response of the pulmonary artery evoked by tyramine. Atropine (10(-4) and 3 x 10(-4) M) and phentolamine inhibited the arterial contractions elicited by exogenous (-)-noradrenaline in an apparently competitive manner. The contractions of rabbit isolated aorta elicited by (-)-noradrenaline, serotonin and histamine were inhibited by atropine (10(-5) and 10(-4) M). Atropine was very much less potent in antagonizing noradrenaline, histamine and serotonin than in antagonizing acetylcholine. tthe inhibotory potency of atropine, procaine and lidocaine on the accumulation of 3H-(-)-noradrenaline by rabbit aorta in vitro was much less than that of cocaine. The relationship between the aortic concentration of 3H-atropine and in vitro accumulation was almost linear. The accumulation was slightly higher at 37 degrees C than at 1 degree C. The results suggest that atropine blocks alpha-adrenoceptors, both presynaptically at the adrenergic neurone terminals and postsynaptically at the smooth muscle. In addition, atropine may possibly act in a nonspecific manner at postsynaptic sites.",
    "output": "Atropine enhances the electrical-field-stimulation-induced outflow of tritium from the pulmonary artery preloaded with 3H-(-)-noradrenaline, but it either has no effect or slightly decreases the tyramine-induced outflow of tritium. This suggests that atropine may have a complex effect on the release and reuptake of noradrenaline and tyramine in the pulmonary artery, potentially blocking alpha-adrenoceptors presynaptically at the adrenergic neuron terminals and postsynaptically at the smooth muscle, as well as possibly acting in a nonspecific manner at postsynaptic sites. However, it does not directly antagonize the tyramine-induced outflow of tritium."

    "instruction": "What concentration of phentolamine was used to shift the lower part of the dose-response curves for certain sympathomimetic amines?",
    "input": "Experiments were carried out on the isolated papillary muscle of the rabbit in order to further characterize the alpha-adrenoceptors mediating the positive inotropic effect. For this purpose dose-response relations of seven sympathomimetic amines were compared under the influence of alpha- and/or beta-adrenolytic drugs. Phentolamine (10(-6) M) shifted the lower part of the dose-response curves for norfenephrine, synephrine and epinine as for phenylephrine and adrenaline to the right, while prindolol (10(-8) M) affected only the upper part of the curves. In the presence of both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents the entire dose-response curves for sympathomimetic amines were shifted in a parallel manner. Noradrenaline affected preferentially beta-adrenoceptors, whereas its effect on alpha-adrenoceptors was so weak that it could be detected only when the neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanism of amines were blocked by cocaine (3 X 10(-5) M) and corticosterone (4 X 10(-5) M), respectively. The effect of dopamine was not affected either by phentolamine or by prindolol, but was antagonized by the simultaneous application of both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. From the present results, it appears that the following relationships are present between the structure of amines and the alpha-adrenoceptor stimulating activity in the heart: (1) N-methylation increases the potency: (2) Absence of the hydroxyl group either in 3 or in 4 position decreases the intrinsic and beta-adrenoceptor stimulating activities, but increases the alpha-adrenoceptor stimulating activity.",
    "output": "The concentration of phentolamine used to shift the lower part of the dose-response curves for norfenephrine, synephrine, epinine, phenylephrine, and adrenaline was 10^-6 M. This effect was not observed with prindolol (10^-8 M), but when both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents were used together, the entire dose-response curves for sympathomimetic amines were shifted in a parallel manner."

    "instruction": "What happened to the heart rate when alpha-adrenergic agonists were administered to the cows?",
    "input": "Experiments were designed to investigate responses of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (PTH) during alpha-adrenergic stimulation and blockade in cows. Alpha-adrenergic agonists (methoxamine, phenylephrine and noradrenaline, the beta-adrenergic action of which was blocked by propranolol) did not change PTH and free fatty acid levels, whereas they characteristically increased the blood pressure and decreased the heart rate. In contrast, alpha-adrenergic blockade by phentolamine progressively increased PTH levels. The elevated PTH concentrations, associated with increased plasma noradrenaline and free fatty acid levels, rising heart rate and decreasing blood pressure, indicated that all these changes can be related to a beta-adrenergic stimulatory mechanism. Beta-adrenergic stimulation was presumably responsible for the initial elevation of PTH concentrations, whereas, during the later phase of the phentolamine infusions, a concomitant hypocalcaemia probably also produced a stimulatory effect.",

    "input": "In an attempt to elucidate the nature of the abnormal vessels in pseudopyogenic granuloma, we performed enzyme histochemical analysis of 10 lesions and correlated them with electron microscopic findings in four lesions. The dermal vessels of pseudopyogenic granuloma possess voluminous endothelial cells demonstrating marked activity of various hydrolytic and respiratory enzymes. The alkaline phosphatase activity, however, is characteristically faint or absent. Electron microscopy reveals that mitochondria and the other common cytoplasmic organelles are abundant in the hypertrophic endothelial cells, probably reflecting increased metabolic cellular activity, whereas specific endothelial granules (Weibel-Palade bodies) are generally sparse in these abnormal cells. Other notable features occurring in several endothelial cells are cytoplasmic vacuolation and the acquisition in the subnuclear zone of dense bodies associated with fine actin-like filaments, 55 to 75 A thick. The latter change is interpreted as evidence of endothelial contraction. Classification of the abnormal dermal vessels using available criteria has proved difficult, but it is suggested that they arise predominantly from the venous side of the microcirculation and are mainly postcapillary venules, although involvement of both larger and smaller caliber vessels also occurs.",

    "instruction": "What types of cells are found in amniotic fluid according to the context?",
    "input": "Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine surface ultrastructural characteristics of cells of the epithelium of female reproductive tract, cervical mucus, and amniotic fluid cells. The female epithelium undergoes hormone-dependent cyclical morphological alterations in cell shape, apical microvilli, ciliation, and secretory patterns. The frequency distribution of ciliated cells varies in different parts of the female reproductive tract and different segments of the same organ. In the endocervix, a few ciliated cells are randomly distributed. The density of ciliated cells is variable in several areas of the endometrium. The sparse distribution of ciliated cells in the central portion of the uterine wall may indicate a possible implantation site. According to surface ultrastructure of cells, three segments are noted in the uterotubal junction: cornual endometrium, interstitial tubal epithelium, and transitional area. The vaginal epithelium is made of flat polygonal cells with interdigitating borders and a fine interlacing network of microridges. After the menopause, the microridge pattern and distinct cell borders are lost or severely modified. Two types of fibrous structures can be found in cervical mucus: a) microfibrils that vary in diameter from 500 to 1,500 A and from bundles or networks, and b) long, thick fibers that vary in diameter from 0.5 to 5 micrometer run parallel to each other, and appear to be made up of microfibrils. Amniotic fluid cells, derived from amniotic epithelium and fetal ectoderm, consist of non-nucleated and nucleated cells with extensive microplicae.",

In transverse section ducts have longitudinal folds, some of which are solid ridges of cells. Four distinctive cell types were distinguished; epithelial cells, lymphocyte type cells, basal clear cells and myoepithelial cells. The epithelium is single layered, multiple at folds, and similar in general morphology to the terminal ductal-lobular unit. Well developed terminal bars may prevent cellular disruption during contraction, and apical cytoplasmic vesicles represent possible secretory material. Basal cytoplasmic bodies may represent transport of secretory products into or from the periductal stroma. Intranuclear vesicles may also be linked to secretory activity. The myoepithelium is well differentiated with numerous cytoplasmic filaments and 9+0 cilia, forming a discontinuous layer around the epithelium. The basal lamina is generally multilaminate. Capillaries are 1-5mum in diameter and exterior to the delimiting fibroblasts of the epithelial-stromal junction.",

    "input": "Unusual inclusions, which occurred in the reticuloendothelial cells intimately associated with fresh amyloid deposits, were analyzed by electron microscopy. The inclusions were located in the areas rich in the primary lysosome type of dense bodies and the cytoplasmic invaginations containing well-oriented amyloid fibrils. They were single-membrane-bounded, measured 0.3 to 0.8 mu in width and 0.5 to several microns in length, and showed considerable variation in the electron density of their contents. The latter consisted of two different ultrastructural elements: fibrillar profiles and a homogeneous or finely granular electron-dense substance. The fibrillar profiles were virtually identical in ulstrastructure to the amyloid fibrils and were well-oriented parallel to the long axis of the inclusion. The homogeneous or finely granular electron-dense substance appeared to be comparable to that composing the dense body matrix. The inclusions were usually acid phosphatase positive, but did not take up intravenously injected Thorotrast particles. These data led us to conclude that these inclusions were transitional forms from the usual dense bodies to the deep cytoplasmic invaginations containing well-oriented amyloid fibrils (which are accepted by most investigators as the sites of amyloid formation) and thus constitute direct evidence for the involvement of lysosomes in amyloid fibril formation.",

    "input": "With the aid of a newly developed technique for the successive examination of both the Golgi and pigment picture of individual neurons (Braak, 1974a) Braak (1974b) demonstrated that within lamina II and upper lamina III of the human isocortex, heavily pigmented non-pyramidal cells are distributed irregularly and sparsely. The lipofuscin pigment granules serve as excellent internal markers to identify these non-pyramidal cells in ultrathin sections. This favourable circumstance facilitates the study of these interneurons in the electron microscope. The heavily pigmented non-pyramidal cells are small, spherical to avoid with diameters of about 12-15 mum. One pole of the cell comprising a large cytoplasmic area gives rise to a few dendrites, while the other pole is occupied by the nucleus and in some cases is in close apposition to another nerve cell body. The nucleus is deeply invaginated by the large cytoplasmic area and occasionally displays nuclear inclusions. Among the usual organelles distributed within the large cytoplasmic area the mitochondria with a moderately electron dense matrix are abundant and the coarse lipofuscin pigment granules are the most striking elements. The latter contain densely packed filamentous or tubular material and a single vacuole. The perikaryon rarely receives more than 3 type I and type tii synapses per section per cell, whereas the dendrites receive numerous synapses of both type I and type II. Within the apposition zone to another nerve cell body (which in no case is a heavily pigmented non-pyramidal cell) puncta adhaerentia occur and also contacts in which the cleft of 8 nm is intersected by a dense stratum. Some of the ultrastructural findings are summarized in the schematic drawing of Figure 15.",

    "instruction": "What is the diameter of the microfibrils present in the various connective tissue layers?",
    "input": "In primates the membrane separating the seminiferous epithelium from the interstitial space is composed of one to three (monkey) or two to six layers (man) of myoid cells associated with one to two layers of fibrocyte-like adventitial cells. All these cells are separated from each other by irregular spaces filled with various connective tissue intercellular components. Subjacent to the elements of the seminiferous epithelium is a continuous, often redundant, basement membrane. A similar basement membrane-like material forms a layer next to and over small areas of the plasma membrane of myoid cells. Collagen fibrils grouped in bundles of various sizes are seen in all connective tissue layers but are particularly abundant in the space between the seminiferous epithelium and the innermost layer of myoid cells. Elastic fibrils demonstrated by the Verhoeff iron hematoxylin technique are also present. Composed of a homogeneous material, the elastic fibrils are short, irregular, branching entities with a diameter comparable to or smaller than that of collagen fibrils. In addition, an abundance of microfibrils with a diameter of 12-15 nm is present in the various connective tissue layers. These microfibrils have a densely stained cortex and a lightly stained core. When seen close to the myoid cells, bundles of micro fibrils appear to insert on well defined areas next to the plasma membrane. These areas commonly face the patches of electron-dense material observed on the inner aspect of the plasma membrane of the myoid cells and in which the actin filaments are inserted. Bundles of microfibrils often span the gap between myoid cells of the same layer as well as those of adjacent layers. Microfibrils are also closely related to the surface of elastic fibrils and are seen intertwining with collagen fibrils. Thus microfibrils appear to bridge and bind together adjacent myoid cells and anchor the surface of these cells to the bundles of elastic and collagen fibrils present in the intercellular spaces of the limiting membrane.",

    "instruction": "What types of staining are used to indicate the presence of glycoprotein and acid proteoglycans in the bounding membrane of vacuoles and electron dense granules?",
    "input": "As chondrocytes degenerate mitochondria frequently become vacuolated. Vacuoles seem to form by an invagination of mitochondria into their own matrix followed by cytoplasmic invasion. The bounding membrane of vacuoles and the electron dense granules which are intermittently dispersed around its periphery are positive when stained with phosphotungstic acid and with silver nitrate methenamine after periodic acid oxidation, indicating the presence of glycoprotein; they are also positive after staining with colloidal iron and bismuth nitrate, indicating the presence of acid proteoglycans. Within vacuoles and apparently arising from their glycoprotein proteoglycan boundary are small filaments composed of granular and filamentous protions. Vacuoles and their contents are exocytosed thus accounting for the presence of granules and filaments in pericellular lacunae. In pericellular lacunae and in the extracellular matrix, filaments interconnect with granules or with collagen fibrils, or both. Filaments decrease in number as the distance from the cell increases, while granules decrease in size but remain numerous. Filaments and granules decrease in the extracellular matrix as collagen fibrils aggregate and as the matric calcifies. Thus, they may play a role in aggregation of collagen fibrils. Filaments and granules also decrease with increasing age. Filaments and granules do not seem to be derived from Golgi vacuoles. They are present in costal, tracheal, and epiphyseal cartilage in three different species of animals.",
    "output": "The types of staining used to indicate the presence of glycoprotein and acid proteoglycans in the bounding membrane of vacuoles and electron dense granules are phosphotungstic acid, silver nitrate methenamine after periodic acid oxidation, colloidal iron, and bismuth nitrate. These staining techniques are applied after the degeneration of chondrocytes, particularly in mitochondria that have become vacuolated. The presence of these stains suggests that the membrane and granules contain glycoproteins and acid proteoglycans."

They were also seen to form bulging and looping configurations which appeared to pinch off into the cytoplasm forming what are recognized as annular gap junctions. These may be attached to the surface or represent separate, intracytoplasmic, nexus-bound inclusions. Their contents varied, but most often they contained glycogen and ribosomal-like particles. Various cell organelles were also seen entrapped, most common of which were membrane coating granules. The development of these annular gap junctions is a prominent feature of many epithelia.

Some vessels had walls composed of clear endothelial cells only. The filaments varied in diameter between 80-120 A. Curling, recoiling and whorling of cytoplasmic filaments were obvious in endothelial cells of contracted vessels.

The filtrability half-times of the washed erythrocytes did not differ from the controls. Thus, the filtrability is altered for extracorpuscular reasons. \"Hypersplenism\" being completely developed, (after 32 MC injections), the filtrability of non-washed erythrocytes repaired when the application of MC had been discontinued, the reticulocyte values remained however increased. Problems of the mechanism of anaemia in experimental \"hypersplenism\" after MC injections in rats and relations between the altered filtrability of the erythrocytes and the haemolysis are discussed.",

The reactions of dimethyladipimidate with proteins in solution and red blood cells, respectively, result in an intermolecular cross-linking. Following an amidination of human serum albumin or human gamma-globulin cross-linked products of increased molecular weight have been demonstrated by polyacrylamide gel and immune electrophoresis. Human erythrocytes previously amidinated intensely, exhibit a restricted motility of membrane particles and cross-linked hemoglobin. Intensely amidinated erythrocytes are resistant against distilled water, and they do no longer agglutinate. The findings presumably indicate an increased permeability of the amidinated red cell membrane. The glycolytic activity was found to be normal in moderately amidinated erythrocytes. In comparison with normal red blood cells, previously moderately amidinated erythrocytes of the rat become sequestered more quickly after re-injection into the vascular system.",
    "output": "The glycolytic activity in moderately amidinated erythrocytes remains normal compared to normal red blood cells. This suggests that the amidination process, while causing changes in the membrane properties and permeability, does not significantly affect the cell's ability to carry out glycolysis, which is the primary energy-producing pathway in these cells.

All of the cells underwent stomatocytosis and inward vesiculation when treated externally with Clostridium perfringens phospholipase C. These results support the idea that there is a correlation between the asymmetric insertion of diacylglycerol (or ceramide) into the membrane and the shape-changes leading to microvesiculation, but they indicate that Ca2+-triggered K+ efflux and diacylglycerol production are unrelated events. Erythrocytes of chicken and turkey showed no Ca2+-stimulated K+ efflux. They showed slight ionophore A23187-stimulated vesiculation, but this appeared to be associated with the appearance in the membrane of ceramide rather than of diacylglycerol.

    "input": "In the erythrocytes of a patient with hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, a homozygous expression of hexokinase deficiency was detected. The mutant enzyme was characterized by normal kinetic parameters with respect to its substrates, glucose and MgATP2-, normal pH optimum, normal heat stability at 40 degrees C, but abnormal behavior with respect to its regulation by glucose-1,6-diphosphate and inorganic phosphate, and an altered electrophoretic pattern. Interpretation of the results revealed the presence of two different hexokinases type I in normal human erythrocytes: one enzyme with a high affinity for glucose-1,6-diphosphate, the inhibition of which is regulated by inorganic phosphate; and another enzyme with a lower affinity for the inhibitor, not regulated by inorganic phosphate. The former enzyme was not detectable in the erythrocytes of the patient, whereas the presence of the latter enzyme could be demonstrated.",
    "output": "The mutant hexokinase enzyme in the patient's erythrocytes showed abnormal behavior with respect to its regulation by glucose-1,6-diphosphate and inorganic phosphate. Unlike the normal enzyme, it was not regulated by inorganic phosphate and had a different electrophoretic pattern, suggesting a change in its structure or behavior. Additionally, the high-affinity hexokinase type I, which is regulated by inorganic phosphate, was not detectable in the patient's erythrocytes, indicating a specific alteration in the mutant enzyme."

    "instruction": "What enzyme activity is suggested to be inefficient and underlying the perturbation of erythrocyte metabolism in uremic patients?",
    "input": "A red cell metabolic abnormality, which diminishes the maximum activity of the pentose phosphate shunt, occurs in some uremic patients, even those adequately dialyzed with fluids prepared from distilled or charcoal-filtered water. Within individual patients the severity of this abnormality does not change even after 9 mo of consecutive hemodialyses. However, between patients it does correlate inversely with hematocrit. When erythrocytes from patients with the abnormality are stressed with oxidant compounds, such as ascorbate, erythrocyte glucose consumption and lactate formation are abnormally increased, while lactate/pyruvate ratios abnormally diminish. Concomitantly, red cell glycolytic intermediates, including fructose-1,6-diphosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, phosphoenol pyruvate, and pyruvate, markedly accumulate. Surprisingly, no increase of 2-phosphoglycerate occurs, which suggests that inefficient phosphoglyceromutase activity underlies this perturbation of erythrocyte metabolism and its associated hemolytic process.",
    "output": "The enzyme activity that is suggested to be inefficient and underlying the perturbation of erythrocyte metabolism in uremic patients is phosphoglyceromutase activity. This inefficiency leads to an accumulation of glycolytic intermediates in the erythrocytes, which contributes to the red cell metabolic abnormality observed in these patients."

    "instruction": "What neurotransmitter is primarily involved in the central actions of amphetamine?",
    "input": "The central stimulant actions of d-amphetamine are not altered in animals in which brain stores of catecholamines have been depleted with reserpine, but they are blocked by alpha-methyltyrosine, which inhibits catecholamine synthesis. The results of a variety of experiments suggest that the central actions of amphetamine result primarily from the ability of the drug to facilitate the release of newly synthesized dopamine from nerve terminals in the forebrain. The results of experiments in animals in which dopaminergic nerve terminals in various brain regions have been selectively destroyed by intracranial microinjection of 6-hydroxydopamine reveal that the locomotor stimulant actions of relatively low doses of amphetamine are dependent upon mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons, whereas the stereotyped behaviors induced by relatively larger doses of amphetamine are dependent upon nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. The central actions of amphetamine appear to be the primary result of interactions with dopamine neurons, but secondarily the drug also alters the dynamics of other putative neurotransmitters (e.g. acetylcholine, 5-hydroxytryptamine) in the brain.",

The text suggests that the central stimulant effects of amphetamine result mainly from facilitating the release of newly synthesized dopamine from nerve terminals in the forebrain.

    "instruction": "What type of receptor do benzodiazepines interact with to exert their pharmacological activity in the CNS?",
    "input": "Studies on the biochemical effects of clinically used psychotropic drugs in brain have shown that they all exert their action by a direct or indirect interference with synaptic transmission. Thus, animal studies in vivo and in vitro have shown that the clinical efficacy of antipsychotic drugs correlates with their inhibitory action on dopamine receptors. In vivo these compounds enhance dopamine turnover in the brain and in vitro they inhibit the dopamine sensitive adenylate cyclase and the binding of dopamine to its receptor at neuronal membranes. Tricyclic antidepressants are drugs which have effects on many transmitter systems. No specific biochemical action has been found which is closely correlated with their clinical potency. However, it appears that a stimulation of the function of the noradrenergic system might have some clinical relevance. Benzodiazepines exert their pharmacological activity in the CNS by interacting with a brain specific receptor. This receptor appears to be part of a larger complex including a GABA receptor and the chloride conductance mechanism associated with the GABA receptor. By binding to their receptor, benzodiazepines appear to enhance the sensitivity of the GABA receptor, thus indirectly potentiating GABA-ergic neurotransmission in the brain.",

    "input": "Considerable evidence exists linking dopamine with schizophrenia. Other neurotransmitters including acetylcholine, serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are also being implicated. Neurotransmitters act via receptors on brain cells and evidence suggests that antipsychotic drugs exert their therapeutic actions and produce side effects by receptor blockade.",
    "output": "Antipsychotic drugs exert their therapeutic actions primarily by blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the brain. This action helps to reduce the excess dopamine activity that is thought to be associated with psychosis symptoms in schizophrenia.\n\nHowever, antipsychotic drugs also affect other neurotransmitter systems, such as the cholinergic and serotonergic systems, which may contribute to their side effects. For instance, anticholinergic side effects like dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision are thought to result from antipsychotic-induced blockade of acetylcholine receptors. Similarly, extrapyramidal symptoms like akathisia and tardive dyskinesia may be due to partial blockade of dopamine D2 receptors in the basal ganglia.\n\nAntipsychotic drugs may also affect GABA receptors, but the role of this mechanism in their therapeutic actions and side effects is less clear.\n\nOverall, the therapeutic and side effects of antipsychotic drugs are thought to result from their ability to block multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the brain."

    "input": "Since 1974 peptides with opiate-like action both in vivo and in vitro have been isolated from the nervous system of various vertebrates and man. The localization of these peptides (endorphins) within the central and peripheral nervous system reflects the possible biological functions in which they may participate: the response of the CNS to painful stimuli (dorsal horn of the spinal cord, central grey matter, thalamus); the control of emotions (limbic system); the regulation of vegetative functions (medulla oblongata); the response of the body to stress the control of endocrine function (hypothalamus, infundibulum, hypophysis); the control of extrapyramidal motor activity (brain stem) or the control of intestinal motility (intramural nervous plexus). Up-to-date knowledge suggests that the endorphins may function as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators or hormones and that such functions vary according to the special sites of synthesis, storage and action of these various peptides within the body.",

    "instruction": "What syndrome is associated with a deficiency of dopamine?",
    "input": "The naturally occurring catecholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline and dopamine, have been found in a wide range of animal and vegetable tissues, but are particularly associated with nervous tissue in animals. Of the many processes affecting the response to stimulation of catecholamine containing nerves, the synthesis of catecholamines, particularly the first enzymatic stage involving tyrosine hydroxylase, and the re-uptake process, whereby the nerve recovers much of the released catecholamine, appear to be the most significant. In peripheral tissues noradrenaline appears to be involved predominantly in the sympathetic control of blood pressure and flow while adrenaline is more important to metabolic processes especially fat and glucose turnover. Both may be released in increased amounts by various stimuli that cause stress or arousal in the body. Dopamine has not yet been shown to have any significant physiological function in peripheral tissues. In the central nervous system, noradrenaline and dopamine are the two main catecholamines. The working of the brain is complex and involves balanced interactions between a variety of neurotransmitters, known or as yet unrecognised. However, noradrenaline appears to play a role in the central control of blood pressure, and in determining mood and activity probably by affecting the emotional drives. Dopamine is certainly important in the control of motor pathways, as shown by the dopamine deficiency syndrome in Parkinson's disease, and is possibly of significance in the abnormal behaviour of psychotics. The role of the small concentration of adrenaline in the brain has yet to be fully established.",

As regard to the effects at synaptic level, a brief review is presented on the available evidence in support of the currently prevailing dopamine hypothesis. 3. Studies carried out on the mechanisms and sites of action of neuroleptics on chromatin show that: a. Behavioral changes caused by psychotropic drugs in experimental animals are associated with chromatin alterations and induced macromolecular syntheses. b. Parkinsonian and possibly drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms are associated with aberrations in protein synthesis. c. Destabilization under \"stress\" of the heterochromatin in schizophrenics seems to be due to histone modifications and is partly prevented by neuroleptic treatment.",

These aberrations may be due to changes in chromatin and alterations in macromolecular syntheses, as observed in behavioral changes caused by psychotropic drugs in experimental animals.

    "instruction": "What is the probable cause of the pronounced increase in plasma catecholamine concentrations, mainly norepinephrine, during physical exercise in patients taking beta-adrenergic blocking agents?",
    "input": "Determination of both catecholamine concentrations (norepinephrine and epinephrine) and the activity of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase in the plasma of health volunteers and hypertensive patients leads to the conclusion that these parameters used together can be considered an index for sympathetic neuronal activity. However, highly specific and sensitive radiometric methods are necessary for the measurement of these biochemical parameters. In healthy volunteers and hypertensive patients after acute and chronic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, e.g., propranolol, practolol or penbutolol, a significantly higher increase of catecholamine concentrations in the plasma has been observed during physical exercise. This pronounced increase in plasma catecholamine concentrations (mainly norepinephrine) is probably due to an enhanced compensatory sympathetic neuronal activity, accompanied by an increased peripheral resistance; this is obviously necessary in order to maintain a sufficient perfusion of peripheral tissues during work load under the influence of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, since an adequate cardiac output is prohibited by blockade of adrenergic beta-receptors. On the other hand, the pronounced increase in sympathetic tone after beta-blockade, especially after administration of high doses, could be responsible for certain reported side effects, such as hypertensive crisis in psychiatric patients or in patients with phaeochromocytoma.",

In cerebral cortex, brainstem, caudate nucleus, and thalamus, most responsive cells were inhibited by the peptides and by normorphine, while in hippocampus all responsive cells were excited. Both inhibitory and excitatory responses were blocked by the narcotic antagonist naloxone. Occurrence of responsive cells encountered in a particular region was loosely correlated with density of stereospecific opiate binding sites as reported by others. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the endorphins and enkephalins may represent a new class of central neurotransmitters; among other functions, these peptides may play a role in the regulation of behavior and the expression of psychopharmacological agents such as the opiate alkaloids.",

We utilized the induction of tyrosine hydroxylase, a catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme, in sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medullae to explore the central and peripheral mechanisms through which choline, various environmental stresses, and drugs that alter blood pressure or central neurotransmission affect various portions of the sympathetic nervous system. Animals received each treatment chronically, and enzyme activity was measured in the superior cervical, stellate, and coeliac ganglia and in the adrenal medullae.2. Choline administration increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity in all four tissues, probably by increasing the release of acetylcholine from preganglionic sympathetic neurones that synapse on catecholamine-producing ganglion and chromaffin cells; carbachol and nicotine had similar effects.3. Insulin enhanced tyrosine hydroxylase activity primarily in the coeliac ganglion and the adrenal medullae, but not in the superior cervical ganglia.4. Reserpine and phenoxybenzamine increased the activity of the enzyme in all four tissues.5. Prolonged exposure to a cold environment increased enzyme activity in all four tissues, but especially in the stellate and coeliac ganglia; forced swimming affected tyrosine hydroxylase only in these two ganglia.6. Several drugs known to modify central neurotransmission were found to increase tyrosine hydroxylase activity in some portions of the sympathetic nervous system but not in others. 5,7-Dihydroxytryptamine, which destroys terminals of serotoninergic neurones, enhanced enzyme activity in all four tissues, but primarily in the coeliac ganglion and adrenal medullae. ET-495 (a dopaminergic agonist), D-amphetamine, and morphine induced tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the adrenal medullae and the coeliac ganglion, but not in the superior cervical ganglia. Oxotremorine, a centrally acting muscarinic agonist, increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity only in the adrenal medullae; its effect was not blocked by methylatropine, a peripheral muscarinic blocker.7. These data indicate that specific neurones in the central nervous system, which utilize specific neurotransmitters and which are differentially affected by drugs and environmental inputs, selectively influence the outflows through the various zones of the sympathetic nervous system.",
    "output": "Oxotremorine, a centrally acting muscarinic agonist, increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity only in the adrenal medullae, not in the superior cervical ganglia.

    "input": "The activity of some mutagens has been investigated in the Salmonella test either in the absence or in the presence of fortified rat liver microsomal fractions, together with an NADPH-generating system. With respect to their metabolic reactivity, the compounds tested could be distinguished according to four reproducible trends: (a) conversion of inert compounds into mutagenic metabolites (e.g. 2-aminofluorene and benzo(a)pyrene); (b) further enhancement of mutagenicity (e.g. 1,2-epoxybutane); (c) no effect on mutagenicity (e.g. glycidol, folpet, nitrofurantoin and 2-nitronaphtalene); (d) slight decrease (e.g. 1,1,1-trichlor 2,3-propenoxide), marked decrease (e.g. sodium nitrite, 5-nitro-2-furoic acid and captan) or even complete reversal of mutagenicity (e.g. styrene oxide, sodium azide, sodium dichromate and other Cr6+ compounds). The Salmonella/microsome test was effective in discriminating not only the mutagenic activity but also the metabolic reactivity of structurally related chemicals (e.g. the fungicides captan and folpet). In some cases, mutagens were tested also in the presence of other biological preparations (e.g. rat muscle or lung microsomal preparations, human gastric juice, serum, plasma or erythrocyte lysates). The mutagenic and metabolic properties of largely used products (e.g. an antibacterial drug containing nitrofurantoin and laboratory reagents containing sodium azide) have been also checked. The mechanisms underlying the metabolic behaviour of some of the mutagens tested have been reported. The results obtained have been correlated with the literature data on their carcinogenicity. Although these in vitro findings are only indicative of the possible metabolic fate of mutagens in the whole organism, the observed effects may be useful in order to explain the epidemiological data and the results of animal tests, and to assess the possible health hazards of mutagens.",

    "input": "Two hundred and nine patients with breast cancer in an advanced stage were treated according to a chemotherapeutic regimen associating doxorubicin, vincristine and methotrexate, administered in courses of 5 days every three weeks. This analysis deals only with the short range results; they confirm those of a previous randomized study. A global objective response was obtained in 187 cases (89%) and a measurable regression of the lesions in 150 cases (71%); in these later cases 90 (43%) had a regression of more than 50 per cent. The most striking effects, often rapidly observed, involve sites which are not generally sensitive: liver (40%), pleura (24%) and bone (only 6%, but 8 times out of 10 a definite action on the pain syndrome). Side effects were, on the whole, acceptable (only one severe hematologic complication); however, the risk of myocardiac toxocity due to the accumulation of doxorubicin limits the utilization of this association. It thus needs to be relayed by other drug regimens which are included in a program of long term action, but has interesting characteristics as induction chemotherapy.",

The highest concentration of the alloantigen was contained in the spleen, followed in descending order by the lymph nodes, lung, skin, kidney, heart and liver. Fat and red blood cells (rbc) contained no detectable antigen. A two-stage physical adherence column method was used to separate T-derived from B-derived lymphocytes and each fraction was tested for the alloantigen. Alloantigen was detected on both cell types.

    "input": "In experimental rabbits heterologous soluble lens proteins consisting of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-crystallins were found to be antigenic; they stimulated a marked antibody response compared to a rather weak T-cell response. The serum antibodies to alpha-crystallins appeared first, to be followed by antibodies to beta- and gamma-crystallins in that order. The rabbits did not respond to heterologous gamma-crystallins unless these were injected with Freund's adjuvant containing mycobacteria. Incomplete Freund's adjuvant (i.e., without mycobacteria) was found to be an inferior immunoaccelerator so far as lens antigens are concerned. The response to lenticular antigens in both magnitude and duration varied in different rabbits, which suggested to us the important role played by a central control mechanism involving the immune response (Ir) genes. Some of the antibodies in potent lens antisera cross-reacted with mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (i.e., microsomes), contractile organelles, and cell nuclei. This explains for the first time at least in part the reasons for the widely observed phenomenon of the reactivity of lens antisera with ocular and extraocular structures. Antibodies to soluble lens proteins as detected by immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase techniques were shown to be of the IgG class. Systemic heterologous immunisation followed by discission of the lens does not lead to the typical changes of phakoallergic endophthalmitis in the rabbit.",

Two of these patients received a 3rd cadaveric graft, of which one is functioning well after two years. All ruptures occurred within three weeks after transplantation, 14 kidneys ruptured during the first week. The clinical course and the operative findings suggested that rejection was the cause of rupture in all cases. This was confirmed by light and immunofluorescent microscopy of specimens from 15 kidneys, while one kidney only demonstrated extensive intrarenal vessel thrombosis. It is concluded that renal allograft rupture signals a strong immunological response in the recipient with poor graft prognosis. The chance of a successful retransplantation is small.",

The two methods have proved their worth in clinical practice. The expectance of life of patients with chronic renal insufficiency could essentially be improved during the last years. In last consequence the successes of the transplantation of kidneys depend on the solution of immunobiological problems, which are not yet cleared up nowadays. 1. In the determination of genotypical determinants possibly not all are known or recognizable. 2. The at present clinically usable examination methods do not yet allow to recognize rejections so early that by an aimed immunosuppressive treatment irreversible damages on the graft may be prevented. After a transplantation of kidneys of relatives a long survival time of transplanted patients is better than after a transplantation of kidneys taken from dead bodies. The rejection is still the main factor of the failure of the graft, the sepsis is the most frequent cause of death. It is neccessary, to develop less toxical remedies for the adaptation of the graft. Nevertheless, thousands of optimally transplanted patients prove the usefulness of the allogenic transplantation of the kidney.",

Routine Papanicolaou, May-Gr\u00fcnwald-Giemsa, metachrome B, and hematoxylin and eosin stains are all useful. Special stains may provide additional evidence for specific diagnoses. Lymph nodes were the most common tissue examined by aspiration biopsy in this series. It was possible to identify the primary tumor site from the aspiration smear in most of the cases. Forty-seven breast cancers were identified from 127 aspiration biopsies of breast lumps. Breast aspirations are the most difficult to interpret, and no deviation from classic malignant smears should be attempted. The false-negative rate for breast aspirations was 7.0%.

Cancer cells were unequivocally identified in 45.8 per cent of the cases with normal bronchoscopic examination and in 52.4 per cent of the cases in which bronchial biopsy did not include malignant tissue. The same proportion of cases with the various tumor types was obtained by cytologic and by histologic study. However, one of the methods often showed a higher degree of cellular differentiation than the other. The number of cases with undifferentiated cancer or unclassified tumors was markedly reduced when the information concerning cell differentiation available through both methods was used. In this manner, excluding the oat cell carcinomas, only 7.6 per cent of the cases of bronchogenic carcinoma did not show any cellular differentiation.

Eleven patients (16 p. 100) died in the late post-operative period (average 4 years). The main cause of death was cardiac failure related to the valvulopathy (8 cases). 11 patients were reoperated (16 p. 100) (on average 5 years after operation). The opeartive findings, besides early technical errors (2 cases), showed deterioration to be less often related to secondary dilatation of the mitral ring (1 case) than to progression of the valvular and subvalvular disease (7 cases). The patients followed up at present have shown symptomatic improvement (39 out of 40 cases) although the cardiothoracic ratio has generally remained unchanged. Average pulmonary capillary and arterial pressures were lower than the preoperative findings in 9 control cardiac catheterisations. Thromboembolism (2.6 p. 100), infection (2.6 p. 100) and haemolysis (0 p. 100) were less frequent than in patients with prosthetic valves. The survival curve is also better in patients having undergone reconstructive surgery. This study showed the best results in the group with pure mitral regurgitation secondary to mitral ring dilatation. The results were less favourable in groups II and III.

Alcoholism can be viewed as a disease with a natural history that is somewhat predictable. Its causes probably consist of a variety of social and psychological factors; evidence for a genetic contribution has been fairly established. Once the alcoholic is identified, dental problems should be treated, but referral to an agency for treatment should also be seriously considered. Such rehabilitation programs offer general support and helping mechanisms to aid the alcoholic to achieve improved functioning in life.",

This has not been due to studies showing negative results, or to a lack of studies reporting positive results. The difficulty has been that the studies failed to satisfy the standards of experimentally minded methodologists. Many methodological problems with respect to patient, treatment, and criterion variables were described which will require a great deal of basic research for their solution. Others may not be soluble. Drawing a representative sample of alcoholics may not be feasible. Assigning patients at random to treatments and no treatment who are uninterested, who desire particular treatments, or who are in need of specific treatments is impractical and socially unacceptable. Matching or randomly assigning therapists to provide consistent, measured, and equal amounts of specific therapies is similarly unrealistic. Determining what constitutes a good therapeutic outcome may be more of a philosophic than a scientific issue. Applying experimental standards to human outcome studies is inappropriate. The state of the art with respect to evaluating the effectiveness of alcoholism treatment is not ready for experimental investigations or cost-benefits analyses.

    "input": "There have been important expansions in knowledge about alcohol recently. In this chapter a number of advances pertinent to the family practitioner are summarized. However, technology is not our focus. We are talking first about troubled people. The applications of research may help such people in practice. However, our main concern is for the patients and their families as a primary care practitioner rightly should be. Therefore, scientific study results are interspersed among the sections on a variety of clinical concerns. Alcohol abuse and alcoholism are family affairs. Families are complex interactive systems that serve to maintain themselves and their members. Under certain conditions the powerful forces at work within a family can promote the use of alcohol as an effort to solve problems. This chapter has discussed some methods which may be used to change them. Alcohol also presents a number of specialized problems that may occur in family practice. We include recent modifications in the treatment of withdrawal. Another syndrome increasingly observed is that of the effects of alcohol on the human fetus. The interesting but less usual manifestations of alcoholism are also noted in passing.",

    "input": "Alcoholism, the most prevalent form of drug dependence, has become a problem for large numbers of women. The research literature on alcoholism in women is reviewed, with suggestions for treatment and future research. The greater stigma placed upon female intoxication has made it difficult to obtain reliable data and has contributed to the tendency to ignore the problem altogether. Furthermore, the greater stigma has resulted in guilt because the woman alcoholic is likely to share society's opinion of herself, and this stigma/guilt/shame factor is viewed by the authors as one of the main difficulties in recovery. Certain recurring characteristics among alcoholic women are listed, and the impact on children is briefly discussed. Treatment suggestions include offering women alternatives during rehabilitation.",
    "output": "The main difficulty in recovery for woman alcoholics, as viewed by the authors, is the stigma/guilt/shame factor. This arises from the greater societal stigma placed upon female intoxication, which the woman alcoholic is likely to internalize, making it more challenging for her to recover."

The staining technique is based on DNA-denaturation procedures and the application of mixtures of basic dye--methylene blue and acid dyes--eosin or fast green at low concentrations. The combination of methylene blue with eosin is used for the staining of ribonucleoproteids (RNP) whereas methylene blue-fast green for the simultaneous detection of ribonucleoproteids and desoxyribonucleoproteids (RNP and DNP), as well as for the differential staining of nuclear DNP (after cold hydrolysis with 5 N HCl). The acid dyes eosin and fast green stain in pink resp. in green some cathionic proteins in the lysosomal (specific) granules of the neutrophilic and eosinophilic leucocytes in the cytoplasm of erythrocytes, and after cold hydrolysis in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes. A fluorescent variant of the method with sulfaflavin is also suggested for the fluorochromation of cytoplasmic cathionic granules in the luecocytes. Acid mucopolysaccharide components in the granules of basophilic leucocytes, tissue mastocytes and thrombocyres are stained intensively pink-violet (gamma-metachromatic). The possibilities for the application of the method in the quantitative analysis of blood and exfoliated cells, as well as for purpose of haematology, immunology and exfoliative cytology are discussed.",

Diamine derivatives of fluorene (2,7-fluorenediamine and 2,5-fluorenediamine) were employed in place of benzidine and the result obtained was satisfactory. Two staining techniques were developed. (1) Smears of peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirates were fixed in 2.5 per cent glutaraldehyde solution for 1 minute. Smears were then washed in tap water and covered either by a saturated solution of 2,7-bluorenediamine or by a 0.05 per cent solution of 2,5-fluorenediamine in the presence of hydrogen peroxide for 5 minutes. After being washed in running tap water they were counterstained with Carazzi's hematoxylin solution for 10 minutes. (2) The second technique employs pretreatment of blood smears with 5 per cent CuSO4 solution and aldehyde fixation was omitted. Smears were counterstained by Giemsa stain. The nuclear chromatin structures were well preserved and nucleoli were easily distinguished in the immature cells. In the first method, clear brown granules were recognized in the cytoplasms. In the second method, peroxidase-positive granules were stained black and the staining of nucleus and cytoplasm resembled that of McJunkin's method.",

    "instruction": "What two dyes were found to best satisfy the requirements for staining cells in liquid suspension?",
    "input": "Flow microfluorometric (FMF) analysis of stained cells has provided protein distribution histograms for large populations of cells. Spectral data and staining protocols were evaluated for six fluorescent protein dyes suggested for staining cells in liquid suspension. The requirements for dyes and/or staining protocol included minimal cell clumping and cell loss, near-optimal dye excitation at existing laser wavelengths, and tenacity of the dye/protein interaction. These criteria were best satisfied by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RITC). Both fluorescamine and 8-aniline-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANSA) showed potential applicability for use in systems where excitation wavelengths in the ultraviolet range are available. Protein staining with fluorescamine was extremely rapid. Brilliant sulfaflavine and 1-dimethyl-aminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl chloride (DANSYL) were found unsatisfactory in these studies, since the former dye tended to diffuse from the cells, while the latter induced excessive cell clumping and cell loss. These techniques have application to immunofluorescence analysis and can also be profitably employed in dual-parameter analysis systems in connection with double-staining techniques for simultaneous DNA and protein analysis.",

    "instruction": "What type of fluorescence is associated with RNA staining in the described acridine orange staining procedure?",
    "input": "Simultaneous staining of deoxyribonucleic (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) in nonfixed, but permeable, cells is described. Cells are made permeable by treatment with non-ionic detergent at low pH. RNA is denatured prior to, or during staining, by exposure of cells to chelating agents to ensure that DNA (native) and RNA (dentured) may be stained differentially with the metachromatic dye, acridine orange. The fluorescence of individual cells is measured in a flow cytofluorometer. A comparison between various staining procedures employing acridine orange or other intercalating dyes in unfixed cells is discussed in terms of staining specificity, cell permeability and preservation. Evidence is provided that acridine orange staining of unfixed cells may be used as a simple, fast means of obtaining information on cell ploidy levels and cell cycle status from DNA measurements (green fluorescence), and cell transcriptional activity from RNA staining (red fluorescence), in human and murine cells lines, peripheral blood and bone marrow specimens from patients with leukemia and mitogenically (phytohemagglutinin) or antigenically (mixed lymphocyte culture) stimulated human peripheral blood cultures. Exposure of cells to detergent at low pH as an alternative to cell fixation or hypotonic treatment is proposed as a fast, convenient method of making cells permeable to dyes.",

    "instruction": "What happened to the purple staining of RNA-rich regions when tissue sections were subjected to acid hydrolysis or to digestion by RNAase?",
    "input": "Selective purple staining of RNA-rich structures such as basophilic cytoplasms of exocrine pancreas and plasma cells, Nissl substance, and nucleoli was achieved by treating tissue sections as follows. Stain dewaxed sections for 1/2 hour in a dyebath containing 0.1% w/v axure A or toluidine blue and 1% cationic surfactant (Hyamine 2389, a 50% w/v aqueous solution of diisobutylphenoxyethoxyethyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride; or benzyldimethylammonium chloride, or cetylpyridinium bromide, or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) buffered to pH 7 with phosphate. Rinse in water, blot, air dry and mount in synthetic resin. Intense purple staining of RNA-rich regions occurred after fixation in neutral formalin or in Carnoy's or Gendre's fluids, though satisfactory results were also found after fixation in acetone or alcohol. Chromatin generally stained a very pale azure after all fixations, though occasionally nuclei were unstained (Gendre's or Zenker's fluids). Subjecting tissue sections to acid hydrolysis or to digestion by RNAase eliminated or reduced the purple staining, but left the azure staining of nuclei unaffected. Satisfactory staining of RNA-rich structures was not critically dependent on the precise concentrations of dye, surfactant or inorganic salts in the dyebath, nor on pH, staining time or chemical nature of the surfactant. The staining patterns can be rationalized with a tissue model that considers both surface charge and permeability factors, since present in the dyebath are small dye cations and large cationic surfactant micelles. As micelles and dye will both quickly penetrate basophilic structures considered to be porous, such as chromatin, competition will then greatly reduce staining of such substrates. But the large micelles will only slowly penetrate regions considered to be more impermeable, such as basophilic cytoplasms, so consequently small fast moving dye ions may enter and stain without competition.",
    "output": "The purple staining of RNA-rich regions in tissue sections was eliminated or reduced when they were subjected to acid hydrolysis or digestion by RNAase. This is because acid hydrolysis and RNAase digestion break down RNA, reducing the presence of RNA in the tissue sections and thus eliminating the target for the dye that stains RNA. The azure staining of nuclei remained unaffected, as it is not dependent on the presence of RNA."

    "instruction": "What happens to labeling intensity when cells are pretreated with spermine before staining with peroxidatic enzymes?",
    "input": "Staining of glutaraldehyde-fixed mammalian cells with peroxidatic enzymes (horseradish peroxidase or horse heart cytochrome c) greatly enhances resolution of their structure under phase microscopy. The topography of cell processes and regions of intercellular contact and overlapping is resolved precisely, even in dense cultures mounted in media which ordinarily do not permit clear demonstration of these areas. The technique is therefore a useful aid to the study of cultured cells with phase optics. Labeling depends on introducing free aldehydes into cells through the use of bifunctional fixatives such as glutaraldehyde. Acetone or formaldehyde fixation prevents staining, and labeling intensity is greatly diminished by pretreatment with spermine, a polyamine that reacts with glutaraldehyde. Electron microscopy reveals that peroxidase tags membranes preferentially; some areas are labeled smoothly, others in a punctate manner. Ribosomes are sharply contrasted, but nuclei remain unstained. Cytochrome c labels condensed nuclear chromatin intensely, and also stains ribosomes and portions of the cytoplasmic ground substance; membranes are mostly unmarked.",
    "output": "Pretreatment with spermine before staining with peroxidatic enzymes decreases the labeling intensity of the cells. This is because spermine reacts with glutaraldehyde, a bifunctional fixative used to introduce free aldehydes into cells, which is essential for the staining process. When spermine is present, it interferes with the staining reaction, resulting in a diminished labeling intensity. This means that the contrast provided by the staining is reduced, making it less effective in resolving the cell's structure under phase microscopy."

The stain facilitates identification of the formed elements and particularly aids in the differentiation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes from lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, and renal tubular cells. A variable staining of casts and their inclusions has been observed. Tumor cells may be recognized by nuclear abnormalities or, in case of hyperchromatic tendency, by a very rapid and early uptake of dye preceding that of the surrounding cells. The staining method is rapid and simple enough for routine urinalysis and screening procedures.",
    "output": "The described stain can aid in the differentiation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils) from lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, and renal tubular cells. However, it's important to note that this stain does not specifically differentiate between these cells, but rather helps identify them based on their staining properties. For example, neutrophils will have a distinctive appearance compared to lymphocytes due to the staining characteristics of the dyes used."

In each of these mutant strains the beta-subunit of the F1 portion of the membrane-bound adenosine triphosphatase is abnormal. In one of the mutant strains (carrying the uncD12 allele) in F1-ATPase aggregate was formed which was purified and found to have low ATPase activity. ATPase activity was absent in the other four strains and the abnormal beta-subunits were tightly bound to the membranes. However, membranes from these strains exhibited various proton permeabilities as indicated by NADH-dependent atebrin-fluorescence quenching and bound different amounts of normal F1-ATPase. The amounts of reconstitution of energy-linked reactions after the addition of normal F1-ATPase also varied depending on the mutant allele. It is apparent that considerable phenotypic variations can occur between strains carrying mutations in the same unc gene.",

This technique was employed to measure the proton permeability of the membranes, which was found to vary among the different mutant strains.

The mutated enzymes differ markedly in activity from the wildtype, even at the permissive temperature. When assayed at the non-permissive temperature, the mutant enzymes are completely inactive. In one of the mutant strains, growth can be completely inhibited by addition of L-phenylalanine or L-tyrosine to the medium.",
    "output": "The amino acids that can completely inhibit growth in one of the mutant strains of Escherichia coli K-12 are L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine. These amino acids are inhibitory because the mutant strain has an altered tryptophanyl-tRNA ligase, which is responsible for attaching tryptophan to transfer RNA (tRNA). Since the mutant enzyme is inactive at the non-permissive temperature, the addition of these amino acids prevents the synthesis of tryptophan, leading to growth inhibition."

    "input": "Several mutants of Escherichia coli affecting aerobic energy generation and energization of the bacterial membrane have been examined for their effect on streptomycin and gentamicin accumulation and susceptibility. A heme-deficient mutant (K207) and two mutants (CJ-8 [colicin K insensitive] and NR-70) associated with defective aerobic active transport were associated with decreased transport of streptomycin and gentamicin and increased resistance to those antibiotics. These mutants also exhibited increased resistance to several other aminoglycoside antibiotics, but not the aminocyclitol spectinomycin. The same observations were made with a ubiquinone-deficient mutant, but a strA derivative of this mutant was shown additionally to be saturable for streptomycin accumulation at a concentration four or more times lower than that required for saturation of the parent. A mutant uncoupled for adenosine 5'-triphosphate synthesis from electron transport and membrane Mg-adenosine 5'-triphosphatase deficient was hypersensitive to those aminoglycosides tested and spectinomycin, and showed enhanced transport of streptomycin and gentamicin. A variety of compounds structurally related to streptomycin were examined at high concentrations for inhibition of streptomycin uptake in a strA mutant of E. coli K-12 SA 1306, but no evidence for competition was detected, suggesting the absence of a common transport carrier. Four different divalent cations were shown to inhibit streptomycin and gentamicin accumulation in E. coli K-12 SA 1306. Divalent cations were shown to inhibit uptake of these two drugs in two bacterial species with distinct cell wall structures, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, and to inhibit streptomycin uptake in spheroplasts of streptomycin-susceptible and -resistant E. coli. However, calcium had almost no inhibitory effect on streptomycin uptake by the ubiquinone-deficient mutant E. coli AN66. These and previous findings have been used to formulate a model for aminoglycoside entry into bacteria using a low-affinity membranous complex involved in membrane energization that includes respiratory quinones, which probably act to bind and transport aminoglycosides across the cell membrane. This phase of transport is associated with the lowest accumulation rate (termed energy-dependent phase I) that is rate limiting for susceptibility. It is further proposed that subsequent association of the membrane-bound aminoglycoside with higher-affinity binding sites on membrane-associated ribosomes carrying out a normal ribosomal cycle and protein synthesis results in a more rapid transport rate (termed energy-dependent phase II). The increased rate could result from a state of membrane energization analogous to that causing enhanced aminoglycoside transport rates seen in the uncoupled mutant, AN120. How this model explains the mechanism by which enzymatically modified aminoglycosides render cells resistant to unmodified aminoglycosides is also discussed.",
    "output": "The mutant that was shown to be hypersensitive to aminoglycosides and spectinomycin, and exhibited enhanced transport of streptomycin and gentamicin is a mutant uncoupled for adenosine 5'-triphosphate synthesis from electron transport and membrane Mg-adenosine 5'-triphosphatase deficient."

    "input": "A mutant of Escherichia coli K-12 deficient in high-affinity leucine transport and related binding proteins was obtained by selecting for azaleucine resistance after bacteriophage Mu mutagenesis. We determined that the cause was a generalized loss of periplasmic binding proteins and a sharp decrease in the activity of transport systems requiring them. Other transport systems resistant to osmotic shock and present in membrane vesicles, were affected to a lesser degree or not at all. The mutation, designated lky::Mucts, was shown to be a pleiotropic envelope mutation, rendering the mutant sensitive to ionic and nonionic detergents, antibiotics, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid: the strain had also acquired tolerance to colicins E1, E2, and E3, while remaining normally sensitive to a variety of bacteriophages. An analysis of the lipopolysaccharide of parent and mutant strains revealed a twofold reduction in the neutral sugar content of the core oligosaccharide of the lky strain, but no change in sensitivities to phages which utilize lipopolysaccharide or outer membrane proteins for absorption. The lky::Mucts locus was mapped by transduction and found to be located near, or in, the tolPAB gene cluster linked to gal. Secondary mutations suppressing the detergent sensitivity of lky arose at a frequency of 10(-7), yielding a variety of new phenotypes. The lky::Mucts mutation did not give rise to obvious alterations in the gross morphology of the cell or in cell division.",

These mutants are specific in that they are conjugation proficient with other types of donor strains. They have an altered susceptibility to phages and detergents. Chemical analysis of the cell envelopes of mutant strains has shown that the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is altered and that one major outer-membrane protein is absent. Conjugation experiments in which LPS from wild-type cells was added to a mating mixture, made up with wild-type donor and recipient cells, showed inhibition in transconjugant formation when an I-type donor, but not an F-type donor, was used. This strongly suggests that LPS of the recipient cell is directly involved in the ability to mate with an I-type donor but not with an F-type donor. The mutations are located in the 78- to 82-min region of the E. coli map, with one exception where the mutation maps near or in the galactose operon.",
    "output": "The type of donor strain that is not affected by the addition of LPS from wild-type cells in conjugation experiments is an F-type donor. This is because, as mentioned in the context, conjugation experiments showed inhibition in transconjugant formation when an I-type donor was used, but not when an F-type donor was used.

Fourteen classes of mutants were distinguished on the basis of phage typing and sensitivity to bile salts. Three of the mutant classes are sensitive to phages to which the parent is resistant. Mutants which are sensitive to bile salts generally lack heptose in their LPS, but two mutant classes are exceptions to this rule. Analyses of the sugars in the purified LPS of all mutant classes indicated that mutants were obtained which are blocked at most stages in core polysaccharide synthesis. On the basis of the chemical analysis, in conjunction with phage typing data and other known properties of the mutants, it is deduced which residue(s) is involved as a receptor for each of the phages used and which residues hinder these receptors. Some of the mutant classes do not seem to be changed in their LPS structure. Many of the mutations map in or near the rfa locus, but some are far removed from this region.",

    "output": "The types of tumor-associated markers that can be detected immunologically for cancer detection and diagnosis include cell surface antigens, ectopic hormones, and normal materials produced in increased amounts by or in response to the tumors. These markers can be antigenic in heterologous species or reacted to by the tumor-bearing host. However, the major current problem is to determine which of these markers may be applied to practical problems of immunodiagnosis."

    "instruction": "What should efforts to design effective therapeutic agents and procedures against malignant tumors be directed toward?",
    "input": "The development of a metastasis is dependent on an interplay between host factors and intrinsic characteristics of malignant tumor cells. The process of metastasis is highly selective, and the metastatic lesion represents the end point of many destructive events that only a few cells can survive. Neoplasms, which are predominantly heterogeneous, contain a variety of subpopulations of cells with differing metastatic potential. Furthermore, metastatic cell variants have been shown to preexist in murine neoplasms of old and recent origin. The possible existence of highly metastatic variant cells within a primary tumor suggests that we no longer should consider a neoplasm to be a uniform entity. Efforts to design effective therapeutic agents and procedures against malignant tumors should be directed toward the few but fatal metastatic subpopulations of cells.",
    "output": "To design effective therapeutic agents and procedures against malignant tumors, efforts should be focused on targeting the few but highly metastatic subpopulations of cells within the neoplasm. This is because these subpopulations are responsible for the destructive events leading to metastasis, which is the primary cause of cancer mortality. It's important to understand and address the heterogeneity of neoplasms, as they contain a variety of subpopulations with differing metastatic potential."

    "instruction": "What is the potential use of serial estimation of tumour-associated macromolecule levels in cancer diagnosis?",
    "input": "The concept of tumour-specific antigens is constantly undergoing reappraisal with the development of more sensitive methods for their detection. This has resulted in the finding that the many 'new' antigens produced by human tumours or materials immunologically closely related to them are also present in non-neoplastic tissues, albeit in small amounts. However, other antigens still appear to exist almost entirely in or on tumour cells so that the antigens of human tumours may be subdivided into either tumour-associated macromolecules or tumour-specific antigens. The elucidation of the chemical nature of the tumour-specific antigens may result in important advances in cancer diagnosis and therapy. As many are organ specific, it should be possible to evolve test systems which will enable tumours to be diagnosed and located before they become apparent clinically. On the other hand the tumour-associated macromolecules, of which the oncofetal antigens are the principal examples, are found in elevated amounts in some non-neoplastic disorders. It is now clear that serial estimation of the levels of these macromolecules is of considerably more diagnostic value than single random measurements. Current work is establishing their value in the detection of recurrent and metastatic tumours before they become apparent by other methods, which is probably their most important role, and also their value as aids to monitor therapeutic efficacy. The future use of both types of antigen may unfold a new era in cancer detection and therapy but many basic chemical and immunological studies are needed before their clinical use can be fully defined.",
    "output": "The potential use of serial estimation of tumour-associated macromolecule levels in cancer diagnosis is significant. These macromolecules, particularly the oncofetal antigens, are found in elevated amounts in some non-neoplastic disorders as well as in tumours. Serial estimation, or repeated measurements over time, of these macromolecules' levels can help detect recurrent and metastatic tumours before they become apparent by other methods, which is probably their most important role. Additionally, they can aid in monitoring therapeutic efficacy. However, more basic chemical and immunological studies are needed to fully define their clinical use in a new era of cancer detection and therapy."

The specificities of these differences, however, and the nature, extent and significance of the most responses to them are often not very clear. Disturbances of the immune system generally contribute little to the occurrence, progression and clinical features of common malignant diseases. The present value of immunological monitoring of cancer patients is rather limited. Immunotherapy remains an experimental mode of treatment, the results of which are often disappointing. Current studies of the host-tumour relationship in experimental animals and man suggest, however, that a wholly pessimistic view is not justified.",

The results of immunotherapy are often disappointing, and the immune system's role in the occurrence, progression, and clinical features of common malignant diseases is generally minimal.

    "instruction": "What percentage of all mammary carcinomas are comprised of favorable histologic types such as well differentiated or tubular adenocarcinoma?",
    "input": "Increased demands are made upon the pathologist to work closely with the surgeon and the mammographer in the interest of early detection. The smallest of cancers and the very earliest phases of neoplastic development are being detected, necessitating fine discriminations between cancer and noncancer. Agreement is not always uniform at these new frontiers of diagnosis, and accuracy is paramount. Tumors are populations of heterogeneous cells. Their morphology lends itself poorly to simple categorization, and their biology is not always accurately reflected in their gross and histologic appearances. Clearly evident to the pathologist are the limitations of morphology, of the light microscope and of routine techniques for examining surgical specimens. Paradoxically, \"noninvasive\" cancers occasionally metastasize, and lymph nodes originally \"free\" of cancer are found to contain metastases on more meticulous re-examination. Notwithstanding these limitations a prognostic statement can be made with relative confidence with regard to certain morphologic types of carcinoma. Pure intraductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma in situ entail negligible threat to normal life expectancy if the breast is thoroughly removed. Other types with a favorable prognosis are intracystic papillary carcinomas and pure mucinous carcinomas. Tumors classified as well differentiated or tubular adenocarcinoma infrequently metastasize and have excellent prospects for cure. Unfortunately, these and other favorable histologic types comprise less than one quarter of all mammary carcinomas. Most carcinomas are without such distinctive features. In this category the degree of anaplasia and the nature of the tumor borders, as well as the presence or absence of blood vessel invasion, dermal lymphatic invasion and metastases in regional lymph nodes, are of major importance in arriving at an estimate of prognosis.",

Since cancer is a perturbation of the control of cell proliferation and differentiation, such research may help to understand, the regulation mechanisms, in particular the role of microenvironment, of long range humoral factors, and of membrane site receptors. Furthermore the kinetics of cell proliferation in a normal tissue, or a tumour, influences its response to radiation or drugs. From this evolves the practical interest in research on hemopoietic tissues and on human and experimental tumors. Finally, the growth kinetics of human tumors explain their natural history and opens prospects for the treatment of intraclinical neoplastic disease and metastasis.",

    "instruction": "What type of irradiation does not increase the frequency of chemical transformation in Syrian golden hamster embryo cells?",
    "input": "A well-documented rationale exists for the study of the induction of cancer at the cellular level. Transformation can be quantitated; its frequency follows a linear relationship with dose and is consistent with a \"one-hit\" phenomenon. Transformed colonies do produce transformed lines with attributes of neoplastic cells including the production of tumors; in vitro activity correlates with in vivo activity to provide evidence that chemically induced carcinogenesis can be studied in vitro. In vitro techniques utilizing mammalian cells in culture have made possible the rapid evaluation of carcinogenicity of agents in man's environment. Neoplastic transformation is inductive and not the result of the selection of preexisting tumor cells. The addition of a host-mediated step in the bioassay makes it possible to decrease the number of false negatives, which may result from the requirement for metabolic activation of the chemical. Thus the in vitro studies described have a high probability of providing practical methods for determining which chemicals in use have a potential of producing cancer. Furthermore, the nature of the cell-target insult interaction can be determined, as well as the chemical nature of the ultimate carcinogen, the degree to which any agent acts alone, be it a chemical, a virus, or irradiation, and the extent to which one agent interacts with another from the same or a different category of carcinogens. Sequential treatment involving chemicals, viruses, and radiation are important, since combinations of various agents may be responsible for an increased risk of cancer in laboratory animals and human populations. The use of multiple agents may also lead to different but specific new types of assays to use for surveillance of our environment for carcinogenic agents. Pretreatment of Syrian golden hamster embryo cells with either X-irradiation or methyl methanesulfonate, but not UV-irradiation, increases the frequency of chemical transformation as does posttreatment with caffeine. Most, if not all, chemical carcinogens will increase the sensitivity of hamster embryo cells to transformation by a carcinogenic simian adenovirus SA7. The enhancement of virus transformation is related to both the length of chemical treatment and the interval between chemical and viral addition. The mechanism of transformation enhancement by various agents has yet to be explained. They may affect a number of molecular processes or cause a modification of existing DNA and thus provide an explanation for carcinogenesis; in fact, in some systems some of these agents may also show mutagenic activity and produce chromosomal aberrations, However, although DNA is the critical site for a mutagen, the critical target(s) of chemical carcinogens is still unknown.",
    "output": "Based on the provided context, it appears that UV-irradiation does not increase the frequency of chemical transformation in Syrian golden hamster embryo cells. This is in contrast to X-irradiation and methyl methanesulfonate, which do increase the frequency of chemical transformation. However, it's important to note that the exact mechanism of these transformations is still not fully understood."

Developmental principles and phenomena common to several tumors and tumor syndromes were identified, summarized, and critically evaluated. Their enumeration may be useful in future cancer research. No single hypothesis on the cause and pathogenesis of cancer appears to apply to all disorders. We believe that multiple causes and pathways lead to the phenotype \"cancer\" and that in particular the pathogenetic relationship between tissue dysplasias and cancers deserves increased attention.",

    "instruction": "What is the term used to describe the phase where chronic granulocytic leukemia becomes more aggressive due to an additional genetic change?",
    "input": "Cytogenetic studies indicate that most tumors are clonal (i.e. unicellular in origin) and have karyotypic alterations. These are not consistent, but non-random abnormalities are being increasingly identified by banding techniques, pointing to the sites on human chromosomes where genes important in neoplastic development are located. It is postulated that tumor progression occurs as a result of genetic lability within the neoplastic clone, leading to emergence of increasingly mutant subpopulations (often recognizable cytogenetically) with more malignant properties. In the context of this hypothesis, acute leukemia, chronic leukemia, and preleukemia can be viewed as differing only in the rate at which an abnormal hemic clone is expanding, with progression to a more aggressive phase (e.g. the \"blast crisis\" of chronic granulocytic leukemia) reflecting emergence of a new predominant subpopulation as the result of an additional genetic change. These concepts, and the cytogenetic data from which they have been derived, may help our understanding of basic tumor biology, and have some practical applications in the diagnosis of human neoplasms.",

    "input": "Echocardiographic patterns in 15 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were compared with those in 30 healthy persons. Correlations with angiocardiographic data indicated that most of the anatomical abnormalities in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be assessed reliably by echocardiography. These include abnormal mitral valve motion, a reduction of the anteroposterior dimension of the left ventricular outflow tract and of the left and right ventricular cavities, increased thickness of the interventricular septum and the posterior left ventricular wall. Comparision of the haemodynamic and echocardiographic data showed that some degree of abnormal mitral valve motion during systole may occur in the absence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. On the other hand, it need not always be present with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Other, hitherto unrecognized, abnormalities in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy detected by this technique were: (1) Aortic valve regurgitation in three out of nine patients with evidence of left ventricular cutflow tract obstruction at cardiac catheterization. (2) Left ventricular inflow tract obstruction at the mitral valve level associated with gross septal hypertrophy (five cases). (3) Abnormal forward displacement of the posterior mitral valve leaflet and of the chordae tendineae during systole in 10 patients, in seven of whom there was confirmatory angiocardiographic evidence. Seven patients with miscellaneous cardiac disorders are described in whom asymmetric septal hypertrophy was revealed by echocardiography. In one of these patients coexisting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was excluded histologically; thus asymmetrical septal hypertrophy is not confined to patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",

A high correlation (r = 0.78) was established between the mass of the left ventricular myocardium calculated with the aid of echocardiography and the actual weight of the left ventricle. The important compensatory role of the ventricular septum is emphasized for the cases of myocardial infarction occurring in the free wall of the left ventricle. Left ventricular hypertrophy was detected by ECG in only 25% of those ischaemic heart disease cases in whom signs of myocardial hypertrophy were revealed by echocardiography.",

    "input": "A study was made of 34 patients with valve defects or arterial hypertension and a haemodynamic picture of left ventricle pressure or volume load. Echocardiography and haemodynamic investigated-established the size and mass of the left ventricle and also enabled its indices of contractility, relaxation and distensibility to be determined. The series was divided in accordance with the dynamic geometry of the left ventricle. In concentric hypertrophy, telediastolic rigidity increased in proportion to ventricular thickness and mass. In eccentric forms and ventricular dilatation, diastolic distensibility was reduced in cases with a high filling pressure. The relaxation values bore no relationship to distensibility and telediastolic compliance. The relaxation rate in protodiastole diminishes in proportion to functional depression of the left ventricle.",
    "output": "The relaxation rate in protodiastole decreases in proportion to the functional depression of the left ventricle. This is based on the findings from the study where it was observed that the relaxation rate in the early diastole (protodiastole) is negatively correlated with the functional depression of the left ventricle. This suggests that a more depressed left ventricle has a slower relaxation rate during early diastole."

    "input": "After post-mortem coronary angiography the degree of ventricular hypertrophy was estimated on 18 hearts. The cases were divided in three groups: 9 hearts with right ventricular hypertrophy, 4 hearts with left ventricular hypertrophy and 5 hearts with hypertrophy of both ventricles. Cytophotometric studies revealed a close correlation between absolute weight of heart segments and DNA content of muscle cell nuclei of both ventricles . Radius and area of lumen, thickness and area of both intima and media were measured at serial cross sections of all three coronary arteries. Using these data indices on coronary sclerosis and, including the heart weight, indices on coronary insufficiency were calculated. By determining these indices for the isolated right and left ventricle and the interventricular septum additional criteria suggesting failure of coronary perfusion were obtained. These criteria disclosed that in cases of right ventricular hypertrophy the connective tissue of the right ventricular myocardium was increased only at high values of the insufficiency indices. On the other hand in cases of left ventricular hypertrophy the morphological features of decreased perfusion of the right ventricle were observed at low index values. In all three groups the increased vulnerability of the left ventricle to failure of coronary perfusion was numerically proved.",

    "instruction": "How many patients with hypertension were classified into group I based on electrocardiographic and chest X-ray criteria?",
    "input": "Assessment of the pathophysiologic changes associated with systemic hypertension has been limited by difficulty in justifying invasive studies of the left ventricle. Echocardiography, because it is notinvasive, offers an attractive method of assessing cardiac dimensions and function in hypertensive heart disease. Fourteen age-matched normotensive subjects and 31 patients with hypertension (but without clinical evidence of coronary artery disease) were studied before receiving any antihypertensive therapy. The patients with hypertension were classified into three groups on the basis of previously established electrocardiographic and chest X-ray criteria: group I, normal electrocardiogram and chest roentgenogram (13 patients); group II, left atrial abnormality by electrocardiogram and a normal chest roentgenogram (8 patients); and group III, left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiogram or chest roentgenogram, or both (10 patients). Mean arterial pressure increased significantly from group I to group II and from group II to group III (P is less than 0.01), and this increase was associated with a similar progressive increase in left ventricular mass assessed with echocardiogram (P is less than 0.01). A significant increase was also found in both posterior wall and septal thickness in groups II (P is less than 0.05) and III (P is less than 0.01). In association with this increased mass a significant decrease in ejection fraction and fractional fiber shortening was demonstrated in groups II (P is less than 0.05) and III (P is less than 0.01) although cardiac index was reduced only in group III (P is less than 0.05). Thus, increased ventricular mass can be identified with echocardiography at an early stage of hypertensive heart disease when only left atrial abnormality is identifiable with electrocardiographic criteria and decreased left ventricular performance occurs with increasing arterial pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy.",

    "input": "This echocardiographic study was designed to assess left ventricular function and pulmonary blood flow in ventricular septal defect. Fifty-one patients aged 2 weeks to 21 years were investigated (group 2). Five of 10 operated patients were studied one week after surgical closure of the defect (group 3) and seven 3 to 6 weeks postoperatively (group 4). The control group consisted of 45 normal subjects aged 2 weeks to 21 (group 1). Left atrium/aortic root dimension ratio (LA/Ao) was used to express the pulmonary systemic flow ratio. Left ventricular chamber size was assessed by measurement of left ventricular end-diastolic dimension and volume. The left ventricular mass and the ratio of end-diastolic volume to left ventricular mass were determined to relate the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy to volume overload. Myocardial function was evaluated using ejection phase indices. Ventricular septal thickness, posterior wall thickness, and echocardiographic patterns of septal motion were also studied. The left atrium/aortic root dimension, end-diastolic volume, and left ventricular mass were significantly greater in group 2 patients (P less than 0.05) than in the normal controls. There was a very good correlation between LA/Ao and pulmonary/systemic flow ratio (r = 0.83). Eleven of the group 2 patients showed asymmetric septal hypertrophy (unrelated to shunt size) but left ventricular function as assessed by ejection phase indices appeared unimpaired. Immediately after operation (group 3) there was a deterioration in left ventricular function in 5 patients as shown by reduced ejection fraction, mean velocity of circumferential shortening, and relative changes in minor axis with systole. Septal motion was impaired but returned to normal in 3 to 6 weeks in 7 patients (group 4). Left atrial/aortic root dimension, end-diastolic volume, and left ventricular mass decreased significantly immediately after operation (group 3) but were still raised at 3 to 6 weeks (group 4).",

In contrast to the ECG, echocardiography permitted good differentiation of ventricular dilatation, symmetrical and asymmetrical wall thickening. Positive voltage criteria (SOKOLOFF) were found in 76% of cases with abnormal muscle mass, but the height of QRS amplitude showed no close correlation with the degree of LVH. The presence of absence of ST/T changes was an unreliable index in predicting wall thickness.

In these patients the cardiac output was normal in spite of impaired contractility and left ventricular wall movement. The impaired cardiac performance was compensated by 1. hypertrophy and 2. dialatation of the left ventricle. In one-vessel disease of the the coronary arteries left ventricular muscle mass was modestly, but not significant increased. Hypertrophy decreased from +20% in one vessel disease to +10% in three vessel disease. In contrast, left ventricular dilatation increased from +23% in one vessel disease to 43% in two vessel disease and to 70% in patients with sclerotic lesions in three vessels. Left ventricular dilatation seems to be the main hemodynamic compensatory mechnism resulting in a relative increase of the pump function of the heart compared to non dilated hearts. However, dilatation leads in the end-phase to left ventricular failure. By increased wall tension in the presence of impaired coronary blood flow dilatation bears the risk of deterioration of left ventricular function.",

The results of this study were as follows:--cardiac ouptut was lowered in groups II and III;--end-diastolic volume was lowered in group II and raised in group III;--LVEDP was raised in groups II and III;--V max and VEC max were lower in groups II and III than in group I;--left ventricular compliance was diminished in groups I and II. Myocardial rigidity of the left ventricle was similar in the three groups. Hypertensive heart disease is therefore characterised by early changes in compliance of the left ventricle. These are associated with geometrical changes in the ventricle: disturbance of the volume/mass ratio of the left ventricle. These findings have therapeutic implications for the importance of beta-blockers.",

Sealant loss, as defined in this study, varied from 33% to 90% with the highest loss occurring in the newly erupted permanent molars during the first six months of the project. These high sealant loss rates are thought to be related to the age of the population which was designed to include children at the ages of peak eruption of permanent molar teeth (ages six and twelve).

Toothbrushing with a fluoridated toothpaste, which is now the usual practice, is effective in reducing caries incidence. Flossing can remove plaque from approximal tooth surfaces, and there is some evidence that it can reduce caries incidence. Dental caries can be largely prevented by highly efficient removal of plaque by toothbrushing and flossing. However, the available evidence suggests that regular prophylaxis by dental personnel is essential to maintain the necessary high level of efficiency. It is not known to what extent individuals are capable of removing their own plaque to the same high level of efficiency. It is probable that only highly-motivated individuals can maintain such a high standard of plaque control.",
    "output": "Based on the context provided, it is probable that only highly-motivated individuals may be capable of maintaining a high standard of plaque control, as this requires consistent and efficient toothbrushing and flossing. However, regular dental prophylaxis by dental personnel is essential to maintain the necessary high level of efficiency."

    "instruction": "What was the percentage reduction in caries increment for DMF surfaces among 6th graders?",
    "input": "A combination of preventive methods have been used to reduce dental caries in children residing in a fluoridated area of Southeastern Michigan. These children had very low restorative treatment levels. The methods used include dental health education, prophylaxis, pit and fissure sealants, topical application of fluoride and restorative care. Prophylaxis, sealant and fluoride procedures were repeated every 6 months. Sealant was applied to all caries-free posterior teeth in the mouth. Three-year results show reduction of occlusal caries increments of nearly 73% for both 1st and 6th school grades. Although at baseline examination there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in mean DMF teeth and surface scores, the difference in mean increments at the end of 3 years was statistically significant (P less than 0.01). Percent reductions in caries increment for permanent first molars in 1st graders were 65.6 for DMF teeth and 66.7 for DMF surfaces. Corresponding figures for permanent teeth among 6th graders were 71% and 58.3%.",

The remaining children of the same age group, 58 girls and 53 boys, served as controls. The orthodontic patients had received repeated hygiene instructions during the treatment period and were expected to rinse their mouth with 0.05% sodium fluoride daily. The percentage distribution of DMF-surfaces indicated somewhat less caries experience in the treated group. A chi-square test showed significantly more intact surfaces on the maxillary first molars, second premolars, canines and central incisors, and mandibular molars and second premolars in treated than in untreated children, and also demonstrated significantly fewer new lesions in the upper second molars at the time of examination in the treated groups. A comparison of the caries experience of the different surfaces revealed significantly more intact surfaces in the treated group and significantly fewer new lesions on the mesial and distal surfaces in treated in untreated children at the time of examination.",

Tooth eruption and susceptibility were also examined in relation to the administration of sealant programs. The children who were part of the control group of a fluoride dentifrice study on the Scottish Isle of Lewis, had low exposure to fluorides, high caries attack and very low restorative treatment levels; so true surface caries distribution was not masked. Variation in tooth eruption and susceptibility suggested that semiannual applications of preventive agents at each year age 10 through 15 might be required. Using hypothetical percentage reductions, the substantial potential benefits for caries control of the early use of completely retained occlusal, as well as buccal and lingual (molars), fissure sealants are conclusively demonstrated. However, improvements in the present technology of fissure sealants and their application are apparently required if these benefits are to be extended to large groups of children.",

The investigation showed a decrease in caries frequency in the primary teeth, but not in the permanent teeth, during the four-year-period. As in the former investigation, regression analyses showed a negative correlation between the level of education of the parents and caries indices, and that the variation of the gingival indices could be explained by socio-economic factors.

The method involves pipeting 1.0 ml of serum or urine into an extraction tube, adding an internal standard together with either a pH 4.9 or pH 8.3 buffer and extracting with chloroform. The drugs in the extract are concentrated by exaporation of the organic layer and identified and quantitated by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) using a column packed with 3 percent OV 17. GLC analysis times are kept below seven minutes by using temperature programming which allows good separations of drugs of widely varying volatilities. All calculations are based on peak areas determined by an electronic integrator.

The biogenic amines were modified by pre-column derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde which stabilizes the molecules, aids in extraction, and improves HPLC detection at the nanogram level. To minimize losses during the sampling procedure a careful collection procedure was designed. We developed a simple sample cleanup in which the samples were thawed, neutralized with KOH, immediately derivatized, extracted into ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and then chromatographed by HPLC. The derivatives were stable in EtOAc for more then 24 h. Interfering amino acids were removed from the EtOAc by partitioning twice with Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 10.0). Complete separation was achieved in ca. 60--90 min on a muBondapak phenyl column using a stepwise gradient of acetonitrile and/or methanol-phosphate buffer (pH 5.1). A variable wavelength fluorometer with a 5-microliter flow-cell was used (excitation 340 nm; emission 480 nm). Linearity ranged from 200 pg to 50 ng onto the column. Precision (R.S.D.) for retention times was 1% and for derivatization and injection 2.5%.

The effects of various eluents are presented. Gas-liquid chromatography was also investigated but lacked the sensitivity achieved by HPLC. The HPLC method is used routinely for the determination of biogenic amines in plasma from pigs with malignant hyperthemia and thermally stressed bovine. Significant differences in levels of biogenic amines were noted between stressed and non-stressed animals. Data on rat brain tissue samples were compared with the trihydroxyindole method and canine heart tissue was analyzed for ventricular norepinephrine and dopamine.

Induction of these cells as well as of clones from P3HR-1 EBV-converted BJAB cells with iododeoxyuridine, aminopterin, and hypoxanthine resulted in the appearance of a nuclear antigen in about 1-6% of the cells 1-4 days after induction. The antigen is different from known EBV-induced antigens like EBNA, viral capsid antigen (VCA) or the D- and R-subspecificities of the early antigen (EA) complex. It is demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence and inactivated after acetone fixation. The antigen was not detectable after induction of uninfected BJAB and Ramos cells nor has it been found in noninduced or induced P3HR-1 and Raji cells. Thus, it appears that EBV-infection mediates the expression of this antigen, for which the name TINA (transiently induced nuclear antigen) is suggested. Sera reacting against TINA generally contained high antibody titers against EBV-induced EA. Only a limited number of highly EA-reactive sera, however, were also positive for TINA. Among 200 sera tested thus far, TINA reactivity was most frequently observed in sera of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (7 out of 28), in sera of the only two patients with immunoblastoma tested and occasionally in sera from patients with Hodgkin's disease and chronic lymphatic leukemia. Among 70 sera from nontumor patients, TINA reactivity was observed three times: two patients suffered from \"chronic\" infectious mononucleosis, the other revealed persistent splenomegaly.",

By using direct membrane immunofluorescence assay, we found that only a small fraction of human peripheral blood and cord blood lymphocytes (CBL), and possibly less than 31% of the T cell-depleted lymphocyte population, carry receptors for P3HR-1 strain of EBV. The number of cells carrying receptors for EBV did not vary considerably among different blood lymphocyte populations from several normal donors. EBV adsorption on lymphocyte subpopulations showed that purified thymus-dependent (T) cells and thymocytes did not adsorb EBV, in contrast to T cell-depleted lymphocyte populations and lymphoid cells from fetal liver and spleen. In CBL infected with EBV strain B95-8, EBNA was detected by anti-complement immunofluorescence as early as 18 h after infection. This indicates that EBNA is the earliest detectable EBV-determined intracellular antigen to appear after infection and before or during lymphocyte transformation by EBV. Transformation was observed only in lymphocyte cultures containing detectable thymus-independent B cells but not in cultures of purified T cells. With one exception (es-b-1), all the EBV-transformed LCL from different origins carried surface-bound immunoglobulins (a B cell marker). These included also the 10 LCL obtained by infecting cultures of adherent cells from different donors. With regard to its surface markers, ES-B-1 appeared to be an exceptional EBV genome-carrying line, and it also lacked the ability to form spontaneous rosettes with sheep erythrocytes (a T cell marker). Therefore, it is possible that ES-B-1 was derived from an atypical B cell or B cell precursor or from a so-called \"null cell\" transformed by EBV.",

    "input": "Human cord-blood lymphocytes were infected with B95.8 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) before and after separation into B- and T-cell populations. Lymphoblastoid cells exhibiting B-cell characteristics appeared after 2 to 3 days of culture in the total population and in the separated B-cell subpopulation but not in the T-cell subpopulation. EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) was detected concurrently with the appearance of lymphoblastoid cells. The proportion of EBNA-positive cells corresponded to that of lymphoblastoid cells, and reached 50% after 4 days. EBNA was present only in cells with B-cell markers. These observations indicate that only B-cells are susceptible to EBV infection, that the transformation occurs within a few days and that EBNA is a valid early marker for susceptibility to EBV transformation.",

To further determine the role of EBV in the causation of this tumor, we measured EBV-specific nuclear antigen (EBNA) and EBV DNA using immunofluorescence and nucleic acid hybridization techniques, respectively. Of 34 BL biopsies, 27 tissues (79%) were EBNA-positive, whereas none of the 25 non-BL biopsy tissues were EBNA-positive. Of 15 BL tumors tested, 14 (93%) were EBV DNA-positive with a mean of 39 (range, 8-86) EBV genome equivalents per cell. Each of the 15 non-BL biopsy specimens subjected to nucleic acid hybridization had less than two virus genome equivalents per cell, although all had serologic evidence of past EBV infection. The findings further supported the possible etiologic role of EBV in African BL and negated the passenger hypothesis. The EBV genome could, therefore, be used as a separating marker between African BL and non-BL lymphomas.",

A wide range of antibody reactivities was encountered. Five patients had serological profiles similar to those of African patients with BL: one and possibly two of these patients harbored EBV-DNA in their tumors. Fifteen patients had low or absent antibody to EBV: tumors from 10 of these patients lacked evidence of EBV-DNA. An unexplained association between elevated antibody (greater than or equal to 1:80) to EBV virus capsid antigen (VCA) and a favorable prognosis was noted in this series; this prognostic observation requires further substantiation. Thus, it appears that EBV-associated BL is inversely proportional to tumor endemicity. An etiological role for EBV in BL remains speculative.",

Cytotoxicity correlated with the percentage of atypical lymphocytes. Cells of three patients with acute mononucleosis-like illnesses failed to show killing activity above those of normal controls. Cytotoxicity against the EBV-negative line was not significantly different for each group. The finding of cytotoxic cells in infectious-mononucleosis patients with atypical lymphocytes suggests that these cells operate in vivo to limit the proliferation of altered EBV-transformed B lymphoblasts.",

Proliferation of EBNA-positive cells at this stage was confirmed by autoradiography. There was a good correlation between the concentration of virus and the number of EBNA-positive cells in the first 5-7 days. The subsequent course of events was found to be influenced by the initial cell concentration and the time of subculture. EBNA production was delayed in cells infected with higher dilutions of virus but subsequently appeared in a high proportion of cells. Indirect immunofluorescence failed to detect viral capsid antigen (VCA) or early antigen (EA) by 10 days.

This reaction, the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction, has attributes of an immune response possessing both memory and specificity. The capacity to stimulate autologous T lymphocyte proliferation depends on the lineage of the lymphoid cell and not on its establishment in continuous culture or carriage of the EB viral genome. The determinant on non-T lymphocytes which stimulates the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction appears to be an Ia determinant.

The relationship between both types of suppressor cells is unclear. On the other hand, mitogen insensitive cells, acting in vitro in a non specific way on normal cell mitosis and cell-mediated cytotoxicity induction, and having macrophage characteristics, are described in viral and non viral tumor bearing hosts as well as in non tumoral animals after hematopoietic hypoplasia.

    "input": "The proliferative response of mouse lymphocytes to syngeneic cellular stimulation upon membrane modification with lectins was studied. Brief pretreatment of stimulator cells (mitomycin-C-treated spleen cells) followed by mixed culture with syngeneic cortisone-resistant thymocytes resulted in a significant proliferative response in the thymocytes. This effect was not due to a soluble mediator and was similar to the mitogenic response after Con A-induced membrane modification reported previously. Because of its general characteristics, we refer to this response as cell-mediated mitogenic response (CMMR). Cell contact between stimulator and responder cells was necessary but not sufficient for the induction of the response. The lectins that generated CMMR were T-cell mitogens. CMMR was generated in all the syngeneic combinations tested and even in allogeneic combinations. No detectable cytotoxic activity towards syngeneic targets cells was produced after CMMR. Moreover, CMMR in allogeneic combinations led to the suppression of the generation of specific cytotoxic lymphocytes. Population analysis with antibodies against T or B cells, nylon wool fractionation of stimulator cells, and tests with peritoneal macrophages and with spleen cells from athymic mice revealed that CMMR depends predominantly on the interaction between responder T cells and stimulator Ig-positive lymphocytes.",

Unseparated CLL lymphocytes showed a poor response to phytomitogens and to allogeneic cells. Subpopulations enriched in E-RFC showed an increased PHA- and a normal MLC-reactivity; the Con A responses, however, were markedly reduced in all experiments. Subpopulations which were T cell depleted showed no reactivity to all mitogens. Purified T cells from normal donors showed a decreased reactivity to PHA, Con A and PWM. The Con A responses were completely abolished in almost all experiments. These diminished responses could be restored by unseparated cells or by small numbers of syngeneic, mitomycin-treated monocytes. The data suggest that mitogen-induced T lymphocyte stimulation in vitro in general depends on the presence of monocytes.",

This reduction in Con A responses can be restored by the addition of unseparated cells or small numbers of syngeneic, mitomycin-treated monocytes.

Replication in vitro was not required for expression of suppressor activity by Con A-activated cells and was blocked in MLR by treating suppressor cells with mitomycin C or irradiation. Kinetics of MLR responses and viability of cultures were not altered by addition of activated suppressor cells. The data are consistent with a direct inhibitory effect of suppressor T cells on antigen-induced DNA replication. These observations extend a model previously described for regulation of antibody synthesis by Con A-activated T cells to control of cell-mediated immune responses. This model should be particularly useful in further definition of regulatory T cell subpopulations, and in investigation of interactions and relationships between such populations.",
    "output": "The treatment that blocked the suppressor activity of Con A-activated cells in mixed lymphocyte reactions, as mentioned in the context, is mitomycin C or irradiation.

Only a minimal number, if any, of the T cells contaminating the B cell suspensions is stimulated to proliferation. This is in contrast to stimulation of the B-cell suspensions without addition of irradiated T cells, where both B cells and T cells proliferate. The irradiated T helper cells have no FcR for antigen-bound IgG, and as well allogeneic as autologous T cells exhibit helper capacity of equal strength.

    "input": "Induction of thymus-dependent lymphocyte (T cell) differentiation was performed in vitro with thymic factors as inducers. T cell precursors from human bone marrow first expressed surface differentiation antigens and then acquired the capacity to form rosettes with sheep erythrocytes. The latter marker could not be induced when cells with differentiation antigens had been eliminated. The proliferative responses to phytomitogens or to allogeneic stimuli appeared to be characteristics of later stages in differentiation that also can be induced or amplified by in vitro incubation of marrow cells or thymocytes with thymic factors. When phytomitogen-responsive cells from peripheral blood were inactivated in vitro, the allogeneic response was enhanced. Although these responses are acquired almost concomitantly, they are therefore envisioned to be characteristics of separate T cell subsets. After immunological reconstitution of patients, the T cell development in vivo involves a succession of differentiation events similar to that described above. Our experiments with mice, using similar methods, have also shown that graft-versus-host inducing capacity is a function of a cell population distinct from that which yields a proliferative response to in vitro stimulation by phytohemagglutinin. These results support our model of sequential differentiation of human prothymocytes into various subsets of mature T cells.",
    "output": "When cells with differentiation antigens had been eliminated from T cell precursors, the capacity to form rosettes with sheep erythrocytes was not induced. This suggests that the expression of these antigens is crucial for the rosette-forming ability of T cell precursors. The proliferative responses to phytomitogens or allogeneic stimuli, however, seem to be characteristics of later stages in T cell differentiation and can still occur in the absence of these antigens."

T cells, but not B lymphocytes, were able to mediate the suppressive activity; since aggregated (Fab)'2 fragments were found unable to generate suppressor cells, it was concluded that the suppressor cell was a T lymphocyte bearing Fcgamma receptors. These cells appeared to be largely radiosensitive. In most cases the proliferative responses remained unchanged. Since NWSM-induced activation is not dependent on the presence of T cells, these results show that, at least in this case, T cells exert their suppressor function directly on B lymphocytes. Whether PWM-induced B cell differentiation is suppressed by the same mechanism or/and by inactivation of T helper lymphocytes remains under investigation.",

    "input": "Draining lymph nodes from mice which had been stimulated with bacterial adjuvants or the skin sensitizing agent, oxazolone, showed a marked increase in cell content, presumably due to lymphocyte immigration. A surprisingly large proportion of these cells exhibit properties of B lymphocytes: the presence of surface Ig, lack of Thy-1-like antigen and responsiveness to lopopolysaccharide (LPS). The relationship between the presence of surface markerand responses to class-specific mitogens, of cells from the stimulated nodes, was established by testing fractionated lymphocyte populations. Enriched T cells did not react to LPS, whereas removal of cells with Thy-1 antigen by specific antisera eliminated the reactions to T mitogens but had little or no effect on the LPS response. The data thus suggest that B cells, which make up a small portion of the circulating lymphocyte pool, are selectively accumulated in lymph nodes stimulated by different immunogens, including T-specific stimulants. This interpretation contradicts the generally accepted assumption, that stimulat lymph nodes trap mostly T lymphocytes.",
    "output": "The typically proportion of B lymphocytes in the circulating lymphocyte pool is relatively small, making up only a portion of the total lymphocytes. However, the context suggests that during the stimulation of lymph nodes by certain immunogens, there is a selective accumulation of B cells in these nodes, which may lead to a higher proportion of B cells compared to the normal circulating pool."

    "input": "Some T and B lymphoid cell lines (LCL) were found to secrete into their supernatants a substance able to stimulate lymphocyte proliferation. This substance produced an increase in [3H]thymidine uptake by mononuclear cells when added to unstimulated cultures (mitogenic effect) or when added to cultures stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or pokeweed mitogen (PWM) (potentiating effect). When complete supernatants were used, the potentiating effect was sometimes masked by an inhibitor of DNA synthesis. Fractionation on Sephadex G-100 separated these two activities. The stimulatory substance eluted at a m.w. range of 15,000 to 30,000, and the inhibitor eluted with the albumin peak. B cells with or without monocytes were the most sensitive to the mitogenic effect, whereas T cells were unaffected. Responses to PHA and PWM were potentiated when T cells were present, but the maximum effect was observed when the proportion of T cells was less than 50%. The stimulatory material may be similar to lymphocyte mitogenic factor and may function as a T cell-replacing factor in B cell stimulation.",

These findings suggested that both the ventricular bradycardia and the atrial fibrillation were caused by frequent APBs and that pacing therapy was unnecessary. Disopyramide was given to 5 patients resulting in suppression of the arrhythmia and relief of symptoms. In one patient there was spontaneous resolution and one patient refused treatment.

Initiation of tachycardia was facilitated in 18 of 21 patients by pacing the ventricle at the slowest possible pacing rate. An inverse relation was found between the prematurity of the tachycardia-initiating premature beat and the interval between the premature beat and the first beat of tachycardia, a finding suggestive of a re-entry mechanism.

Twenty-five subjects (50 percent) had episodes of marked sinus arrhythmia as defined by spontaneous changes in adjacent cycle lengths of 100 percent or more. Fourteen subjects (28 percent) had sinus pauses of more than 1.75 seconds, usually during sinus arrhythmia.

Of 25 patients (50 percent) having premature ventricular contractions, only 1 (2 percent) had more than 50 such contractions (86) in 24 hours. In conclusion, frequent atrial and ventricular premature beats are unusual in a young adult male population.

Atrial pacing resulted in persistent (four) or occasional (one) normalisation of the QRS complexes to that seen in sinus rhythm in those five patients with ventricular tachycardia.

The incidence was 12.7 per cent. Twenty-seven episodes of fast ventricular tachycardia (less than 125/min) were noted in 16 of these patients. Eighteen patients had anterior myocardial infarction and 19 inferior myocardial infarction. The mechanism of onset of accelerated ventricular rhythm was classified as escape in 65 episodes. Ventricular premature beats were noted close to episodes of accelerated ventricular rhythm in 31 patients and fast ventricular tachycardia in 14 patients. The morphology of accelerated ventricular rhythm was similar to the ventricular premature beats in 27 patients and similar to the fast ventricular tachycardia in 12.

There were three deaths due to shock and heart failure. Three episodes of fast ventricular tachycardia progressed to ventricular fibrillation and were successfully cardioverted. It is concluded that accelerated ventricular rhythm is a relatively common complication of both anterior and inferior myocardial infarction. The high incidence of concomitant fast ventricular tachycardia, the frequency of ventricular premature beats with similar morphology and coupling time, and the instances of two arrhythmias having common rate multiples, suggest that at least in some instances accelerated ventricular rhythm may represent an ectopic focus with exit block.",
    "output": "The percentage of patients with acute myocardial infarction who experienced accelerated ventricular rhythm during the 1 year period was 12.7%. This means that 12.7% of the 119 episodes of accelerated ventricular rhythm were noted in 37 patients."

The relative systolic area of the carotid pulse curve in the postextrasystolic beat was used as an indicator of the degree of postextrasystolic potentiation (PESP). A close correlation between PESP and CI was found only in sinus rhythm patients (r = -0.85). The patients with junctional and ventricular rhythms had no PESP regardless of CI or the degree of heart failure. Compensatory pause (CP) in these patients surprisingly related (r = 0.95) to heart rate, slower rates having a shorter relative CP.",

    "input": "Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia may result from re-entrance in the AV node, the normal A-V pathway with an accessory AV connection, in the sino-atrial node, in the atria, or else reflect ectopic impulse formation in a spontaneously automatic supraventricular focus. Electrocardiographic criteria which are helpful in differentiating these mechanisms involve an analysis of cycle length, changes in cycle length with intermittent bundle branch block, P wave morphology and the relationship of P wave to QRS complex, P-R interval, the presence of A-V block during tachycardia and the influence of autonomic tone on the tachycardia. Electrophysiologic studies further elucidate mechanism by demonstrating the mode of induction and termination of the tachycardia, the characteristics of antegrade and retrograde A-V conduction curves and refractory periods, atrial activation sequence of echo beats and the influence of premature beats introduced during tachycardia. These features are summarised in Table 1. Therapy can be accurately planned according to the results of experimental administration of antiarrhythmic agents and of pacing sequences upon induction and termination of tachycardia in the catheterisation laboratory.",

To explain this paradox, adenylate cyclase response to glucagon was studied in partially purified membranes of rat livers obtained throughout perinatal life and at 3 months of age. The adenylate cyclase response to glucagon (10(-9) M) was only 7% of the adult response at day 15 of fetal life and 20% on the 21st day. No until after the 30th day postpartum did not reach maturity. Yet, the adenylate cyclase response to stimulation by NaF was comparable to the adult response throughout fetal life. The binding of [125I]iodoglucagon (2 X 10(-9) M) by these membrane preparations was only 1% of the adult level at day 15 of fetal life and increased to 23% at the 21st day, and, like the adenylate cyclase response to glucagon, did not reach maturity until after the 30th day of postnatal life. In contrast, insulin binding on the 15th day of gestation was 11% of the adult level and on the 21st day 45% of the adult level, reaching adult levels by the 30th postnatal day. An increase in membrane-associated particles, reflecting intramembranous protein, was observed during prenatal life, but the mean particle number per mum2 reached adult levels on the 21st day of fetal life, indicating that subsequent changes in hormone binding were clearly independent of non-specific changes in the number of particles. The findings suggest that the fetal liver is less sensitive to glucagon action than the adult liver, and that this glucagon \"resistance\" is mediated by a reduced capacity of the hepatocyte to bind glucagon at a time when substantial binding of insulin is demonstrable. Selective discrimination against glucagon may be important in promoting the anabolic processes required for normal fetal development.",

A sharp decrease in glycogen in the adrenals was observed in 17.5-day embryos, and an appreciable accumulation in the liver in 18.5-day embryos, which coincides with the beginning of the glucocorticoid function. Decapitation and encephalectomy performed at an age of 17.5-19.5 days of development of the embryos, were invariably accompanied by a significant increase in the glycogen content in the adrenals and a decrease in its level in the liver in the case of investigation after two days.

By the second postnatal day, enzyme activities towards the neonatal group have attained, or approached adult values. 4. Dexamethasone precociously stimulates in 17-day foetal liver in utero transferase activities in the late foetal, but not the neonatal group. A similar inductive pattern is found for 15-day foetal liver in organ culture. 5. It is suggested that foetal glucocorticoids, whose synthesis markedly increases between days 16 and 20 of gestation, are responsibile for triggering the simultaneous surge of all the hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities in the late foetal group. The neonatal group of activities apparently require a different or additional stimulus for their appearance. 6. The relationship of these two groups of transferase activities to other similar groups observed during induction by xenobiotics and enzyme purification is discussed.",

This means that the enzyme's ability to metabolize these specific substrates in a newborn rat's liver has significantly increased and is nearly equivalent to that of an adult rat's liver. However, it's important to note that this process is stimulated by foetal glucocorticoids, which are synthesized in increased amounts between days 16 and 20 of gestation.

Ten days after birth the activity was low, at the same level as in the adult rat. In the period after PCS hepatocytes began to show signs of enzymatic activity at the periphery of the hepatic lobules, which subsequently spread through the whole lobules.

    "input": "The activity of enzymes with a regulatory function in the pathways of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, NADPH generation and fatty acid synthesis was measured in the placenta and liver of rats. Compared with the liver, a high activity of pyruvate kinase was found in the placenta, indicating a high glycolytic potential; a small capacity for gluconeogenesis was also present and a moderate to low activity of enzymes associated with lipogenesis. The activity of all placental enzymes fell from day 15 to 20 of gestation irrespective of the pathway they represented. The pattern of decline continued when the gestation was prolonged up to day 26 by the administration of chorionic gonadotropin. The rates of activity disappearance over 11 days of gestation differed for each enzyme, with half-lives ranging from 2.7 days for NADP-malate dehydrogenase to 7 days for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. In contrast, the activity of hepatic enzymes either remained unchanged or showed individual adaptation to the advancing pregnancy. The regression in placental metabolic capacity after day 15 of gestation was also evident by the decrease in glucose uptake and its channelling to lactate, CO2, glycerol and fatty acids. In addition, placental ageing was associated with triglyceride accumulation, mainly due to the decrease in free fatty acid oxidation. Treatment of pregnant rats with several hormones, while markedly affecting the hepatic enzyme activities, failed to induce appreciable changes in the corresponding placental enzymes. This was illustrated in the case of triiodothyronine treatment. Similarly, insulin deficiency induced by streptozotocin failed to elicit adaptive changes in placental enzyme activities typical of diabetes like those occurring in the maternal liver; some converse responses in the placenta were attributed to hyperglycaemia. On the other hand, responses in some fetal liver enzymes were suggestive of fetal hyperinsulinaemia. These observations indicate that placental enzymes are not susceptible to endocrine regulation and imply that placental metabolism is largely independent of the physiopathological alterations affecting the maternal organism. The gradual activity decreases with gestation suggest that the enzyme complement of the placenta, once developed, is designed to last through its limited lifespan without continuous replenishment. Within this context, no mechanism seems to operate to ind1ce the adaptive synthesis of individual enzymes, and the age of the placenta appears to be the primary factor determining its enzyme activity and metabolic performance.",

In hypophysectomised fetuses, the increase of the activity is suppressed but not the decrease. Moreover, if the mother is adrenalectomized the decrease and the increase are abolished in hypophysectomised fetuses. Growth hormone administration is quite effective in preventing the decrease in enzyme activity but cortisol treatment does not prevent it. In contrast, cortisol produces a precocious decrease of the activity in intact fetuses. These findings suggest that during fetal life, two hormonal regulation mechanisms are involved in the regulation of amylo-1,6-glucosidase activity: cortisol has a repressive effect on the enzymic activity while growth hormone acts as an inducer.",

In the foetal aorta (19th day) the E.Z. were moderate or weak and restricted to a few metabolic pathways: glycolysis, diaphorases, esterolysis of some nucleotides and glucosaminoglycan (GAG) metabolism. During the neonatal period (1st-3rd day), the pre-existing E.A. increased; some aerobic and lipolytic activities became histochemically detectable; longitudinal and radial gradients became established. These changes seemed to provide evidence of increased morphogenic activities and metabolic exchanges. During the prepuberty and puberty period (10-20th day-2nd month) all the E.A., as well as metachromasis and pyroniophilia increased, and new E.A. appeared (GluDH, GPDH, 5/Nase, Ac.Pase-Ca++, Mg++, pH 7.2). These changes appeared to be related to cell proliferation and connective tissue increase during the period of fast aortic growth. The increase of some E.A. (Est/ase, Ch. est, ATPase-Ca++, Mg++, 5/Nase, Alk. Pase) suggested a correlation between enzymatic differentiation and hormonal maturation. During adulthood (6-12th month), the E.A. were stable except for 5/Nase, lysosomal and lipolytic activities which increased. Some E.A. were found to be high (diaphorases, glycolytic and esterolytic enzymes), or moderate (aerobic oxidoreductases, lysosome, lipolysis and GAG-linked E.A.), while others were weak or absent (glycogen pathway E.A.). These observations seemed to correlate with synthetic processes and defence mechanisms. Ageing (17th month) was characterized by an increase of metachromatic GAG and acid lipids and by a decrease of pyroninophillia. Lysosome, glycolysis and phospholipogenesis-linked E.A. increased.

Cholinephosphotransferase (CPT), the terminal catalyst of the choline pathway, also showed diminished activity in lungs of anencephalic fetuses, with a mean of 120 pmol/min/mg protein compared to a control value of 190. Dexamethasone treatment of these animals for 6-12 hr led to enhanced choline incorporation rates. Corticosteroid administration also restored CPT activity and even elevated the enzyme to a mean level (340 pmol/min/mg protein) greater than that found in normal fetuses at 21-22 days of gestation.

    "instruction": "What is the percentage increase in disaturated phosphatidylcholine content in fetal lung between day 19 of gestation and the first postnatal day?",
    "input": "Glucose, a major metabolic substrate for the mammalian fetus, probably makes significant contributions to surface active phospholipid synthesis in adult lung. We examined the developmental patterns of glycogen content, glycogen synthase activity, glycogen phosphorylase activity and glucose oxidation in fetal and newborn rat lung. These patterns were correlated with the development of phosphatidylcholine synthesis, content and the activities of enzymes involved in phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Fetal lung glycogen concentration increased until day 20 of gestation (term is 22 days) after which it declined to low levels. Activity of both glycogen synthase I and total glycogen synthase (I + D) in fetal lung increased late in gestation. Increased lung glycogen concentration preceded changes in enzyme activity. Glycogen phosphorylase a and total glycogen phosphorylase (a + b) activity in fetal lung increased during the period of prenatal glycogen depletion. The activity of the pentose phosphate pathway, as measured by the ratio of CO2 derived from oxidation of C1 and C6 of glucose, declined after birth. Fetal lung total phospholipid, phosphatidycholine and disaturated phosphatidylcholine content increased by 60, 90 and 180%, respectively, between day 19 of gestation and the first postnatal day. Incorporation of choline into phosphatidylcholine and disaturated phosphatidylcholine increased 10-fold during this time. No changes in phosphatidylcholine enzyme activities were noted during gestation, but both choline phosphate cytidylyltransferase and phosphatidate phosphatase activity increased after birth. The possible contributions of carbohydrate derived from fetal lung glycogen to phospholipid synthesis are discussed.",

The child's adaptation and adjustment are briefly discussed and the influence on these of the home, medical and educational services is considered. Handicap is seen to be created by a combination of the functional limitations imposed by the disability and by the reaction of society to it. Successful integration is considered to be in some way dependent upon efforts which will reduce both this secondary socially induced handicap and also any peer group stigmatization. Positive professional attitudes and intensive family centered support and guidance are considered essential to the successful habilitation of the disabled child.",

Much of these data and reports are published in journals normally not read by physicians. On occasion, such publications are reported in newspapers or lay magazines. Thus, parents may know of ideas and suggestions before the professional. It is understandable that the parent of a handicapped child would continually seek out improved ways of helping his or her child. The treatment of choice is basically special education. Medication will minimize the hyperactivity and distractability; psychotherapy may minimize the emotional effects. However, special educational therapy for the underlying learning disabilities is essential. No one yet has a rapid or \"guaranteed\" cure. Parents are often caught in the middle. They turn to their physician for guidance. It is the purpose of this paper to review the significant literature in an effort to assist the family physician in providing this guidance.",

The psychiatry of inadequacy is considered and the validity of the various diagnoses used. Finally it is suggested that the place of psychiatry in their care should be reconsidered and that a better knowledge of social handicap should be acquired.",
    "output": "In the care of multiproblem families, it is suggested that the role of psychiatry should be reconsidered, and a better understanding of social handicaps should be acquired. This is because these families often have complex issues, including child upbringing practices and learning disorders, which might not be adequately addressed by traditional psychiatric approaches alone. Instead, a more comprehensive approach that takes into account the social and environmental factors contributing to these families' problems might be more effective."

Mainstreaming refers to the practice of integrating disabled students into regular classrooms as much as possible. Accountability involves ensuring that schools are providing an appropriate education for these students. Certification standards will likely be adjusted to accommodate the needs of these students and to ensure that occupational therapists are equipped to work with them effectively. Additionally, there may be a focus on the development and implementation of competency-based occupational therapy preparation programs to better serve these students in public schools."

During the past three years, we have examined 18 patients in whom this diagnosis was established by transtracheal aspirate or blood culture. Our study suggests that H influenzae, both typable and nontypable strains, is a more frequent cause of pneumonia in adults than previously appreciated. We found no clinical values that distinguished H influenzae pneumonia from other bacterial pneumonias. A properly performed Gram's stain of a transtracheal aspirate specimen is classical in its appearance and facilitates instritution of appropriate initial treatment. The emergence of both typable and nontypable organisms resistant to ampicillin makes it important that organisms be isolated from reliable samples for sensitivity testing. With appropriate therapy, the prognosis for patients with H influenzae pneumonia appears to be good.",

Possible bacterial pathogens were identified in sputum cultures from less than half of the episodes; no pneumococci were found, and Staphylocococcus aureus was the only bacterium associated with a longer illness than that seen when only normal flora were recovered. Much disease diagnosed as \"pneumonia\" in adults with sickle cell anemia is probably pulmonary infarction. Many of these patients will recover with no more than modest supportive care; if antibiotics are used they should be directed against S aureus (and possibly Hemophilus species).

Staphylococci predominated in abscesses that followed accidental or surgical trauma. Compared with fully sensitive control organisms, microbes infecting half the patients were resistant to penicillin. The prognosis of abscess of the CNS is grave, and the microbiological findings have important consequences for treatment. Prompt inoculation of specimens to culture plates and prompt incubation are mandatory if bacteria are to be cultured. Inhibitors of antimicrobial agents should be added to culture media if antibiotics have been administered.

Available methods are limited, and definitive assessments of innovative or controversial practices are infrequent. Nevertheless, some evaluations have successfully enhanced the use of effective practices and diminished the reliance on ineffective ones. Greater efforts at evaluation can improve the quality of patient care, avoid waste and promote the more rational use of health resources. The cost of assessing new practices should be viewed as an intrinsic part of the cost of medical care. Physicians and medical societies bear primary responsibility for recognizing the need for this evaluation, for enlisting other experts, participating in technology assessment and working to translate the results of evaluation into practice. The commitment of government agencies, insurance companies and teaching institutions is also essential to an effective program of evaluation.",

Nursing must meet this challenge by updating the attitudes of nurses and by improving their abilities and skills in developing and implementing planned patient education programs. Application to patient education of educational theory and of teaching-learning principles improves the quality and effectiveness of the programs. This can be demonstrated by improved compliance rates, decrease in number of hospital re-admissions, and decreased morbidity. A hospital or agency committee set up to organize and coordinate the various educational programs can help to stimulate development of programs, control quality, and avoid duplication of effort.",
    "output": "The effectiveness of planned patient education programs can be demonstrated by several potential outcomes. These include improved compliance rates, which indicate that patients are following the recommended treatment plans and lifestyle changes. A decrease in the number of hospital re-admissions suggests that patients have a better understanding of their conditions and are able to manage them effectively outside of the hospital setting. Decreased morbidity is another indicator, showing a reduction in the occurrence of complications related to the patient's condition. These outcomes are achieved by applying educational theory and teaching-learning principles to patient education, and by organizing and coordinating educational programs through a hospital or agency committee."

The incongruence between patients' needs and their demands is discussed and the question is raised as to whether the nurse's skills and knowledge currently acquired will be appropriate to meet patients' needs and demands in the future. Future patient needs and demands are not the only external pressures on changes in the nurse's role; advances in medical treatment and technology and changing roles of other health professionals are others. The paper highlights the dilemma between the profession having to give way to such external pressures or the risk of preparing nurses for irrelevant roles. A case is made for greater interchangeability of first level health care workers through a common portal of entry. It is suggested that diversion into the various professional fields should occur after the foundation course to health care and suitable counselling. Among the top level professionally qualified nurses should be both generalists and specialists. A speciality of nursing generalism, as a parallel with general medical practice, is advocated. A plea is made for a liberating rather than a restricting interpretation of professionalism so that necessary changes in the nurse's role can be initiated and directed by the profession rather than being forced upon it by external pressures.",
    "output": "The paper suggests that a specialty of nursing generalism, similar to general medical practice, is advocated among top level professionally qualified nurses. This approach would allow for a common portal of entry for first-level health care workers, with diversion into various professional fields occurring after the foundation course. This approach is proposed to facilitate greater interchangeability among health care workers and to prepare nurses for a future where patient needs and demands, as well as advances in medical treatment and technology, are likely to require a more adaptable workforce."

    "instruction": "What are some of the medical care variables that are influenced by the interaction of reimbursement methods and physician preferences?",
    "input": "Physicians are the dominant group in our health care system. Their decisions often influence the ways by which society's resources are used to achieve and maintain health. But physicians are also social and economic beings; their behavior is, in part, determined by the way they are reimbursed. Reimbursement methods and physician preferences interact on important medical care variables: utilization of services; treatment setting; practice location and specialty choice; and the efficiency of an individual physician's practice.",
    "output": "Some of the medical care variables that are influenced by the interaction of reimbursement methods and physician preferences include:\n\n1. Utilization of services: Reimbursement methods can affect the volume of services a physician provides, as they may incentivize more or less service utilization based on payment models. For instance, fee-for-service reimbursement encourages more procedures and tests, whereas capitation or bundled payments may lead to more conservative care.\n\n2. Treatment setting: Reimbursement methods can influence where physicians choose to practice, as certain settings (e.g., hospitals versus outpatient clinics) may offer higher reimbursements. This, in turn, can affect the accessibility and cost of care for patients.\n\n3. Practice location and specialty choice: Physicians may be more likely to practice in areas with higher reimbursement rates or where demand for their specialty is greater. This can exacerbate health disparities in underserved areas.\n\n4. Efficiency of an individual physician's practice: Reimbursement methods can impact the efficiency of a physician's practice by incentivizing faster appointments, more efficient use of resources, or prioritizing certain procedures over others. This can affect the quality of care and patient satisfaction.\n\nOverall, the interaction between reimbursement methods and physician preferences plays a significant role in shaping the healthcare system, influencing various aspects of medical care delivery and resource allocation."

    "input": "The need to extend the search for health beyond the current efforts to control disease is emphasized by citing the deficienceis of the current health care model systems. The escalating costs of health care delivery, the emphasis of the current system on treating episodic illnesses rather than chronic disabilities, and the fact that the health care system has less of an impact on health status than socio-economic and life style factors represent major deficiencies in health care delivery. Further, the fragmentation and specialization in education and health care, the exclusion of behavioral science teaching, and the teaching of behavioral determinants of diseases are additional deficiencies of health professions education. The need to develop clear and explicit national health policies, including monitoring of health both of people and communities using indices that relate not only to diseases but also to the qualitative aspect of life, is viewed as an essential prerequisite for the health care system. The assignment of much greater priority to the training of a community health worker and health educator is stressed.",
    "output": "The major deficiencies in the current health care delivery system, as per the provided context, include:\n\n1. Escalating costs of health care delivery: The costs associated with health care are rising, making it difficult for many individuals to access necessary care.\n\n2. Emphasis on treating episodic illnesses rather than chronic disabilities: The current system focuses more on treating acute illnesses rather than managing and preventing chronic conditions, which often require long-term care and management.\n\n3. Less impact on health status than socio-economic and lifestyle factors: The health care system has less impact on overall health status compared to factors such as socio-economic status and lifestyle choices.\n\n4. Fragmentation and specialization in education and health care: The current system is often fragmented, with different specialists focusing on specific areas of health, which can lead to a lack of coordinated care.\n\n5. Exclusion of behavioral science teaching: The education of health professionals often does not include behavioral sciences, which are crucial for understanding and addressing the psychological and social determinants of health.\n\n6. Lack of teaching about behavioral determinants of diseases: Understanding the behavioral factors that contribute to diseases is essential for effective prevention and treatment, but this is often not adequately addressed in health professions education.\n\n7. Need for clear and explicit national health policies: Clear national health policies are necessary for guiding the health care system and ensuring that resources are allocated effectively.\n\n8. Lack of monitoring of health at both the individual and community levels: Monitoring health using indices that consider not just diseases but also the quality of life is essential for understanding and addressing health issues.\n\n9. Need for greater priority in training community health workers and health educators: Community health workers and health educators play a crucial role in promoting health and preventing disease, and their training should be given greater priority."

    "input": "The value of bone marrow colony-forming assays in monitoring transplanted patients has been assessed by comparing results from two pairs of bone marrow recipients. One pair received marrow from their identical twins for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; the other pair were grafted with allogeneic marrow from their siblings for aplastic anaemia. One of each pair showed successful engraftment while in the others the grafts failed. The colony-forming assay was then used to investigate marrow function in five grafted aplastic patients. Of these, four rejected their first grafts and required further immunosuppression before engraftment could be accomplished. The remaining patient was immunosuppressed at the outset with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and her first graft was successful. Sera from all five patients inhibited colony formation by normal human marrow and it is suggested that this activity was related to graft rejection as well as to the pathogenesis of the condition.",

The blood platelet Td was reduced from 111 h to 53-57 h, and granulocyte Td from 57 to 40 h in transplanted groups. The mean blood cell counts were reproducible enough to be used as a biological assay of the amount of bone marrow cells transplanted. Linear relationship between increment of blood cells up to day 16 and number of bone marrow cells transplanted on day 1 was demonstrated (1,200 granulocytes and 14,300 platelets/mul blood per 10(5) bone marrow cells). The linearity suggested a mean Td less than 22.5 h of proliferating bone marrow cells, and allowed a rough estimation of mouse bone marrow stem cell radiosensitivity (Do 76 rad).",

These have been derived in the past mainly from bone marrow. This report describes studies and their results that indicate that granulocytic progenitor cells, measured in cell culture systems as \"colony forming units in culture - CFU-C\", can be collected in large quantities from the peripheral blood of human blood donors by continuous flow leukapheresis. They can be stored at ultra-low temperatures. Their recovery rate after thawing and washing is better than 85%. In a canine model, evidence was obtained that the presence of CFU-C in a suspension of mononuclear blood leukocytes is also indicative for the presence of pluripotent hemopoietic stem-cells. Therefore it is suggested that stem cells can also be collected from human blood as an alternative source for bone marrow reconstitution.",

    "input": "Pre- and post-transplant bone marrow samples from 20 patients with aplastic anemia were studied. Morphologic evidence of marrow reconstitution was noted in 18 patients one to three weeks following transplantation. In most instances the engrafted marrow elements in early weeks appeared as small clusters of erythroid or myeloid precursors. Bone marrow biopsy or clot sections obtained four to eight weeks after transplantation were more cellular with larger clusters of hematopoietic cells, which were most often composed of mixed cellular elements, including megakaryocytes. Two patients with morphologic evidence of engraftment died shortly after transplantation and were excluded from further analysis. In four of the remaining 16 patients grafts were \"rejected\" three to eight weeks after transplant. A fifth patient who received a marrow graft from his identical twin showed a transient increase in marrow cellularity without clinical improvement. However, the second marrow transplantation in this patient using the same donor after conditioning with cyclophosphamide resulted in moderate clinical improvement. In four of the five patients developing graft \"rejection\" or failure there was an increase in marrow mast cells in pre- and post-transplant marrow samples. In contrast, only two of 11 patients with successful engraftment had an increase in mast cells. Although the pathophysiologic role of mast cells in marrow transplantation is unclear, the present study suggests a possible inverse correlation between the numbers of marrow mast cells and the likelihood of successful engraftment. Bone marrow samples in patients with graft versus host disease displayed a slight increase in the number of eosinophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells.",

Nine days later, colony-forming units (CFU) were counted in the spleens of mice given 10(5) cells, and 15 to 21 days after irradiation thymus weights and in some experiments 3H-thymidine uptake or total thymic cellularity were determined in the recipients of 10(6) cells. It was found that in the majority of mouse strains studied there were no significant changes with age in marrow CFU. In contrast, thymic regeneration was significantly impaired when the recipients received marrow cells from donors 100 weeks of age or older. These observations and results obtained in dose-response and time-course studies are best explained by an age-related decrease in marrow T cell progenitors; however, certain findings suggest that in addition the proliferative capacity of these stem cells may at times be moderately impaired.",

    "input": "Two patients, one with an autosomal and the other a sex-linked form of severe combined immunodeficiency, had more than 95% B cells in their peripheral blood. Despite an increased absolute number of B lymphocytes, the patients were unable to produce serum antibodies. In each patient, geno- or pheno-identical bone marrow transplantation was followed by the visualization of a thymus shadow and the appearance of both cellular and humoral functions. Chromosome of allotype studies showed that the T cell originated from the donor whereas serum immunoglobulins were synthesized by host B cells. In these patients the pathogenesis appears to be a selective defect of bone marrow precursor T cells without concomitant intrinsic B cell defect. The successful outcome of the graft in these two patients, who are now, respectively, 5 years and 11 months of age and free of infections, indicates that the preferred form of therapy in such patients is transplantation of bone marrow stem cells, which populate the thymus and mature slowly into T cells that cooperate fully with host B cells in synthesis of antibody.",
    "output": "Both patients experienced a successful outcome after receiving the bone marrow transplantation. They are currently 5 years and 11 months old, respectively, and have been free of infections. The transplantation allowed the visualization of a thymus shadow and the appearance of both cellular and humoral functions. The T cells originated from the donor, while serum immunoglobulins were synthesized by host B cells. This indicates that the bone marrow transplantation of stem cells was effective in these patients, as the T cells matured slowly into functional cells that cooperated fully with host B cells in the synthesis of antibodies."

Fourteen days after such injection, the platelet counts are found to be proportional to the number of bone marrow cells injected and can be used as a measure of platelet progenitors. Perturbation of the milieu in which the transplanted marrow is placed by host preirradiation, bleeding, or erythropoietin administration leads to enhanced thrombopoiesis. It has been shown previously that similar perturbation favors erythropoiesis at the expense of granulopoiesis. The data from these and other experiments appear to be consistent, with a model of the stem cell compartment as a continuum with proliferative activity increasing as commitment is restricted. These functions vary inversely with the capacity for self-renewal. The various stem cell assays measure different ranges of stem cells, but overlap within this continuum.",

Chambers were removed at regularly scheduled intervals over a period of 28 days. Total and differential cell counts were then done on the contents of each chamber. Normal human bone marrow showed an orderly pattern of growth and differentiation which was not found with leukemic bone marrow. Monocytes and macrophages were the predominant cell types in the diffusion chambers filled with normal marrow after day 10 of culture. Although leukemic specimens showed predominantly leukemic cells, a few mature polymorphonuclear leukocytes could be found throughout the entire culture period. Questions about the nature of the defect in acute myelocytic leukemia and the significance of the in vivo culture system are discussed.

After anti-thymocyte globulin treatment followed by allogeneic bone marrow infusion, the recovery pattern resembled that in non-transplanted patients.

    "input": "To block renin activity, a nonapeptide converting-enzyme inhibitor was given to 65 seated hypertensive patients. Depressor responses occurred only when control plasma renin activity exceeded 2 ng of angiotensin I per milliliter per hour and correlated directly in amplitude with control plasma renin activity and with induced increments in activity (P less than 0.001 for both). Depressor responses, like renin activity, were characteristic for renin subgroups as defined by renin-sodium profiling. Before and after sodium deprivation, the nonapeptide reduced diastolic pressure in all patients with high renin (by 17.3 and 19.8 per cent) and most patients with normal renin (by 9.1 and 17.7 per cent). Low-renin patients remained unresponsive. This enzyme blockade may cause bradykinin accumulation. But if, as seems likely, depressor responses are due to blockade of angiotensin II formation, the results indicate that, irrespective of sodium balance, measurements of plasma renin activity reflect its contribution to blood-pressure maintenance. The results suggest broad participation of the renin system in common forms of hypertension.",

    "instruction": "What percentage of women with a history of hypertension during pregnancy had a suppressed PRA response to standardized treadmill exercise, excluding those on oral contraceptive agents?",
    "input": "Plasma renin activity is suppressed in approximately 25% of patients with essential hypertension, and the rate of in vitro angiotensin I production after addition of exogenous renin (renin reactivity) is increased in plasma of hypertensive patients. We have recently observed that blood pressure (116 +/- 1.5/68 +/- 1.7 mm Hg) of young women who had hypertension during a first pregnancy 3--6 years earlier (n = 63) was higher (p less than 0.005) than blood pressure (109 +/- 1.4/61 +/- 1.7 mm Hg) of women who remained normotensive during pregnancy (n = 52). To determine if alterations of the renin-angiotensin axis observed in patients with established hypertension also occur in young adults with relatively high blood pressure, plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma renin concentration (PRC), plasma renin substrate (PRS) and plasma renin reactivity (PRR) were compared in these two groups of subjects. Overall, PRA and PRC were inversely related to systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.02). Excluding women on oral contraceptive agents, the PRA response to standardized treadmill exercise was suppressed (less than 1.0 ng/ml/hr) in 19% of women with a history of hypertension during pregnancy and in no women who remained normotensive throughout a previous pregnancy; PRR did not differ (p greater than 0.8) in the two groups of young mothers (27.1 ng/ml/30 min +/- 1.2 SE VS 26.2 ng/ml/30 min +/- 0.9 SE). Thus, renin suppression, but not increased PRR, precedes the onset of hypertension. Oral contraceptive usage was associated with higher systolic blood pressures, increased PRS, and low PRC. Highest blood pressures and lowest PRA occurred in women with a history of hypertension during pregnancy who were taking oral contraceptive agents at the time of study.",

    "input": "1. The pressor role of renin stimulated by chronic diuretic therapy has been assessed in 31 patients with essential hypertension by infusing the angiotensin II antagonist, saralasin, immediately before and at the end of 2 weeks' treatment with the diuretic, chlorthalidone. 2. Under diuretic therapy the change in blood pressure caused by saralasin was found to be correlated to plasma renin activity values, in such a way that small pressor responses were again observed in patients whose renin was mildly stimulated by the diuretic, whereas a marked depressor response occurred in patients whose renin was markedly increased. 3. On the other hand, the hypotensive effect of chlorthalidone was correlated to values of plasma renin activity under diuretic therapy in an opposite direction: indeed little or no decrease and sometimes an increase in blood pressure were observed in patients with marked renin activation by diuretic therapy. 4. It is concluded that stimulation of renin release by chronic diuretic therapy can be considered a factor limiting the hypotensive activity of diuretic drugs.",
    "output": "The relationship between the hypotensive effect of chlorthalidone and plasma renin activity values under diuretic therapy is inverse. This means that a marked increase in plasma renin activity under diuretic therapy can limit the hypotensive activity of chlorthalidone, resulting in little or no decrease in blood pressure, or even an increase in blood pressure. Conversely, a mild stimulation of plasma renin activity by the diuretic is associated with a greater pressor response to saralasin, indicating a more pronounced hypotensive effect of chlorthalidone. In summary, stimulation of renin release by chronic diuretic therapy can be considered a factor that limits the hypotensive activity of diuretic drugs."

    "input": "Injection of saralasin or converting-enzyme inhibitor produced a small variable reduction of blood-pressure in rats with two-kidney hypertension. Prolonged infusion of the inhibitors gradually reduced blood-pressure to normal. Control infusions of saralasin in normal animals and of dextrose in normal and hypertensive animals did not reduce blood-pressure. Plasma-renin concentration correlated significantly with the early but not with the later fall of blood-pressure. Plasma-concentrations of renin and angiotensin II were closely related except in rats receiving converting-enzyme inhibitor, when angiotensin II was relatively reduced. The gradual reduction of arterial pressure by saralasin was not associated with increased urinary sodium excretion.",
    "output": "In rats receiving a converting-enzyme inhibitor, the plasma-concentrations of angiotensin II are relatively reduced compared to the plasma-concentrations of renin. This reduction is not observed in rats not receiving the inhibitor. The decrease in angiotensin II concentration is likely due to the inhibition of the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a key step in the renin-angiotensin system, by the converting-enzyme inhibitor. This reduction in angiotensin II may contribute to the gradual reduction of blood pressure to normal observed in these rats."

The control rats were injected with physiological saline. Various measurements were made in conscious rats on the 10th day of the treatment. As compared with the control, plasma renin concentration and serum sodium increased significantly, while plasma aldosterone and renal excretory function did not differ. Blood volume (BV) expressed as per body weight increased significantly, but absolute BV, absolute or body weight-related plasma volume and hematocrit were not significantly different. The hypotensive effect of 1-Sar-8-Ile-angiotensin II was negligible 12 hours after the preceding injection of kidney extract. It was small but significant 1 hour after the injection. Increase in water turn-over and fractional sodium excretion occurred during the development of hypertension. Spironolactone did not significantly modify the developmental course. We observed increased depressor response to hexamethonium and increased reactivities to noradrenaline and angiotensin II (A II); these response curves relatively resembled those of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Hypertensive vascular changes were seen in the kidney and heart by histology. Thus, it was suggested that a direct vascular action of A II played a partial role in this hypertensive process while aldosterone played little role. The significance of BV increase and possible contribution of A II's other actions were discussed.",
    "output": "Spironolactone did not significantly modify the developmental course of hypertension in the rats studied. This is based on the observation that despite an increase in blood volume and reactivities to certain substances like noradrenaline and angiotensin II, the aldosterone levels did not differ significantly from the control group. The study suggests that while angiotensin II may play a partial role in this hypertensive process, aldosterone may play a lesser role. However, it's important to note that this is a specific finding from this particular study and may not be universally applicable to all cases of hypertension or in other species."

    "input": "As a result of effective beta adrenergic blockade with either propranolol or practolol, plasma renin activity was suppressed in all of 11 patients with cirrhosis and ascites. In contrast, the effect on the rate of renal excretion of aldosterone was variable, suggesting that factors other than the renin-angiotension system are responsible for the control of aldosterone secretion in cirrhosis. The changes in aldosterone could not be explained on the basis of changes in the plasma concentrations of potassium or sodium. The renal sodium excretion was inversely related to the values for aldosterone both before and after beta adrenergic blockade, indicating a major role for aldosterone in regulating sodium excretion. A number of patients had an abnormal intrarenal distribution of plasma flow with a relative hypoperfusion of the renin-secreting outer cortical nephrons. Plasma renin activity was inversely related to outer cortical plasma flow, suggesting that the reduced outer cortical flow may be a stimulus to increased renin secretion. Because the abnormal intrarenal hemodynamic pattern was not corrected by suppression of plasma renin activity, and presumably angiotension II concentrations, it is unlikely that it is attributable to the known renal vasonconstrictor effects of angiotensin II.",
    "output": "The relationship between renal sodium excretion and aldosterone values, both before and after beta adrenergic blockade, was inversely related. This means that as aldosterone values increased, renal sodium excretion decreased, and vice versa. This suggests a major role for aldosterone in regulating sodium excretion. Despite the suppression of plasma renin activity with beta adrenergic blockade, the variability in the effect on aldosterone secretion indicates that factors other than the renin-angiotensin system are responsible for its control in cirrhosis."

In plasma samples from normal subjects and patients with untreated essential hypertension, the concentration of inactive renin (as measured after acidification) was on average 4-5 times higher than the concentration of active renin (as measured without acidification).2. Plasma angiotensin II concentration was correlated to active renin but not to inactive renin. 3. A hyperacute stimulation induced by infusion of saralasin resulted in a marked rise of active renin, whereas inactive renin remained unchanged. 4. An acute stimulation induced by frusemide and ambulation led to a considerable rise in active renin and a slight, but significant, rise of inactive renin. 5. Stimulation with oral thiazide over 5 days induced a seven-fold rise of active renin, with a doubling of inactive renin. Thiazide treatment for 3 months led to a four-fold rise of active renin and a three-fold rise of inactive renin. 6. There was no difference between the concentrations of inactive renin in systemic plasma, ipsilateral and contralateral renal venous plasma in 12 patients with renovascular hypertension, neither before nor after infusion of saralasin with the associated fall in blood pressure. 7. We conclude that the time constants pertinent to secretion or release of active and inactive renin in man are of different orders of magnitude.",
    "output": "Thiazide treatment for 3 months resulted in a four-fold rise of active renin and a three-fold rise of inactive renin in the subjects.

High aldosterone was more often in patients with high renin, and low levels of aldosterone were usual in those with low and normal renin. In order to study the mechanism by which aldosterone and renin acitvity are suppressed in low-renin hypertension, 25 patients (13 normal-renin hypertensives, 10 low-renin patients including 4 non-responders and two DOC excess hypertensives) were investigated as inpatients. Plasma renin activity, aldosterone and cortisol were determined by the following stimualtions with 3 days of sodium restriction and 2 hours of upright posture, angiotensin II infusion (at a dose which increased 20mmHg of diastolic blood pressure), ACTH administration (rapid i.m. injection of 0.25 mg of alpha 1-24  preparation) and potassium infusion (30 meq of potassium i.v.). Responses of aldosterone in normal-renin hypertensives to all stimulations were 3-5 fold increases from bases line values. Low-renin hypertensives except two of four non-responders showed the responses similar to those in normal-renin patients. The responses of two of the non-responders were similar to those in DOC excess hypertensives who showed reduced responses of aldosterone to some of these stimulations.

    "output": "After captopril administration in patients with severe hypertension, plasma renin activity increased significantly. This increase occurred in response to the marked decrease in arterial blood pressure and plasma aldosterone concentration that was induced by the inhibition of angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II) with captopril. However, after 3 days, arterial blood pressure tended to increase again, but the addition of hydrochlorothiazide kept arterial pressure significantly below pretreatment control values, suggesting that the increase in plasma renin activity may have contributed to the maintenance of lower blood pressure."

Test procedures: 1) Circadian rhythm (0600, 1600 and 2400h). 2) Adrenal stimulation test (ACTH: 12.5 I.U.). 3) Adrenal suppression test (Dexamethasone: 1.0 mg). 4) Metopirone test (1.5 g). 5) Angiotensin II infusion test (8 ng/kg/min). 6) Saline infusion test (1000 ml/hr). Patients with low PRA showed significantly lower levels of PRA than those of other two groups in circadian rhythm, after 2 hours of ACTH infusion and after angiotensin II infusion. Furthermore, these patients showed significantly higher responses of PRA than other two groups after furosemide test under dexamethasone and after metopirone test. In case of saline infusion test, patients with low and normal PRA did not show significantly decreased levels of PRA after the infusion, though all patients with high PRA and all control subjects showed significantly decreased levels of PRA. From the present studies, it might be concluded that patients with low PRA has an unknown mineralocorticoid excess which is ACTH dependent and 11 hydroxylated and some of hypertensive patients have an abnormality in their renin-angiotensin-aldosterone volume feed back loop as a factor for hypertension.",

Such measurements can now be made on individual living cells at rates of up to 103 per second and the cells separated on the basis of the anisotropy function alone or combined with other physical signals using a multiparameter automated computer-controlled cell separator (MACCS). Thus, selection can be on the basis of simple or complex algorithms reflecting the size, macromolecular content, and rotational mobility of cellular components or liganded reporter molecules. Cells isolated in this manner are sterile, viable, and can be used for outgrowth or biochemical studies related to dynamic changes occurring during differentiation or malignant transformation.",

The majority of these studies have employed in vitro methods and utilized the tools of modern cellular and molecular biology. These include microdissection; cell separation; tissue or cell culture; enzyme, lipid and protein chemistry as well as immunochemistry, ultrastructural visualization, cell organelle and membrane fractionation and the use of genetic markers. With these tools it is possible to study the interaction of the major space-occupying cells of the atherosclerotic plaque (especially the arterial smooth muscle cells) with many of the blood components, especially the lipoproteins and the other serum factors that appear to influence cell division.

    "instruction": "What is the maximum flow speed at which the cell volume activated flow imaging device can operate?",
    "input": "The morphological identification of cells by flow cytometry is difficult. Usually cell sorting and microscopical analysis have to be used in addition. Morphological analysis is simplified by taking cell pictures from a range of particular interest immediately during flow cytometric analysis. Instruments using the video scanning technique for fluorescence imaging are slow and expensive (8, 10). Morphological information can also be obtained by transmission imaging of cells in flow, which requires shorter exposure times. Therefore a cell volume activated flow imaging device has been developed which operates at flow speeds up to 5 m/sec and which depicts transmission images of selected cells on a 16-mm film by a nsec flashlamp illumination. An electronic unit detects the particles in the optically accessible orifice, performs the pulse height analysis, triggers the flashlamp if particles are in the preselcted range of interest and feeds the film. The instrument is capable of delivering up to 150 pictures per second and works either as a flow microscope in which the cells in the preselected volume range are directly observed, or as a picture system in which the cell pictures are stored on the 16-mm film for documentation or for image analysis.",

The hardware and software elements are described as well as the various photometric functions that can be performed. The aim is to obtain a multiparameter analysis of morphology, cytochemistry, cell surface characteristics, and metabolic activity including cell cycle characteristics for any set of cells selected from a sample. The combination of DNA synthesis rate determination in a really quantitative approach with the analysis of features of nuclear chromatin texture opens up a new field for associating morphology with functional properties. Examples of application are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the system in a heterogeneous cell population of a very limited sample size. For this purpose, human peripheral blood cells grown in diffusion chambers in preirradiated mice were investigated. It is shown that, depending on their functions, different cell types may have quite different nuclear-to-cell area ratios. Further, a crude morphological parameter, such as the degree of basophilia of Giemsa-stained cells, may be associated with the rate of DNA synthesis, thus bearing information on the replicative activity of a cell. Cell surface properties related to the leukemia-associated cALL antigen are investigated in a human-derived cell line and correlated with cell-cycle characteristics. It is concluded that different antigenic sites rather than cell-cycle dependent differences of antigen density account for the outcome of a bimodal distribution.",

At the same time a survey of the principal possibilities in the medical morphological diagnostics is given. By the analysis of the digitalised pictures of cells, cell organelles and other tissue structures reproducible quantitative data on outline and texture as well as on the special arrangement of the objects present in the picture are obtained. On the basis of these characteristics it is possible to identify cells, to find perhaps existing subgroupings in cell populations or to perform an automatic preselection of the material to be investigated.

This was accomplished by using peroxidase/anti-peroxidase immunological staining and indirect immunofluorescence with rabbit antisera that had high neutralizing titers against the HSV-specific thymidine kinase activity and virus infectivity. HSV-1 antisera reacted with antigens in cells biochemically transformed by type 1 HSV, but not with those of cells biochemically transformed by type 2 HSV. Similarly, HSV-2 antisera reacted with antigens in cells biochemically transformed by HSV-2, but not with those in cells biochemically transformed by HSV-1. In contrast, herpes virus-related antigens were detected in cells cytolytically infected with HSV-1 and with HSV-2 by either type 1 or type 2 HSV antisera. These observations suggest that the antigens detected in the biochemically transformed cells were a type-specific subset of the HSV-related antigens synthesized in cells undergoing productive infection by HSV-1 and HSV-2.",

On the contrary, HSV-1 DNA transcription was totally unaffected by amanitin in AR1/9-5B cells, a mutant subline of CHO cells that possesses an amanitin-resistant RNA polymerase B.

The monocytes (10(5.0) cells) were infected (10(7.0) PFU HSV) either immediately after isolation or were cultured in vitro for varying numbers of days and were then infected. Inoculation of freshly isolated monocytes resulted primarily in an abortive infection. HSV antigens were produced by the cells, as determined by a indirect fluorescent antibody technique, and empty herpes capsid structures were detected by electron microscopy of the inoculated monocytes; however, no increase in virus titer was noted in the cultures. Inoculation of viable cells that had been maintained for 7 days in culture resulted in a productive infection. An increase in titer was noted 24 hours after inoculation, and normal virus maturation was documented by ultrastructural study of the infected cells. The experiments show that the interaction of HSV with human mononuclear phagocytes is complex, and the data suggest that whether or not the cell replicates infectious virus may depend on the functional activity of the cell.",
    "output": "Freshly isolated monocytes inoculated with HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus) undergo an abortive infection. This means that HSV antigens are produced, and empty herpes capsid structures are detected, but there is no increase in virus titer in the cultures. This suggests that the cell does not replicate infectious virus immediately after isolation. However, if the monocytes are cultured for 7 days and then inoculated, a productive infection occurs, with an increase in virus titer and normal virus maturation documented.

Even though infectious virus production eventually ceased, the cell lines continued to produce herpes-specified proteins as measured by immunological techniques. These cells also showed herpesvirus-like structures in the electron microscope. The persistently infected cells that produced HSV antigens and bore HSV sequences were resistant to superinfection by HSV-1. The resistance was not due to failure of adsorption of the virus or to the production of interferon by the cells.

The expression of viral genetic information was studied in newborn mice infected with wild-type and ts mutant viruses; some mutants had become attenuated and had lost pathogenicity for newborn mice while others had not. From induction experiments in HSV=transformed hamster cells, it appears that detection of enhanced replication of ts mutants in human cancer cells would be an indication of resident HSV genetic information. Sera obtained from cancer patients were examined for antibodies to early proteins synthesized in HSV-infected cells. The method used was an indirect radioimmune precipitation test followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of immune precipitates. Cervical cancer patients had sera with a higher reactivity to early nonstructural polypeptides than to breast cancer patients or to matched healthy women.

    "input": "The mean values of serum immunoglobulins A, G, M and D levels in 42 psoriasis patients showed no significant difference from those of control subjects. Analysis of the same sera for the presence of antiglobulin antibodies also yielded negative results. Antinuclear factor could be demonstrated in only 4.8% of the cases. The possibility that serum antiglobulins get drained into the lesions making their detection in the serum difficult, is supported by our preliminary findings of focal deposition in the stratum corneum of immune complexes of IgG, IgM and complement in tissue sections of psoriatic lesions from these patients.",

Over 60% of RA patients had some increase in complexes in their sera, while nearly 90% had synovial fluid complexes. Moreover, the levels of complexes within the joint were much higher than in the serum. Both IgG and IgM antiglobulins were raised in most RA patients. The levels of IgG antiglobulins--and to a less extent IgM antiglobulins--were nearly always higher in synovial fluid than in the corresponding serum sample.A strong correlation was found between the levels of immune complex and IgG antiglobulin.

Immunoglobulin IgM was invariably significantly raised in TT, BT and LL subgroups of leprosy patients compared to the control but variation among different subgroups was statistically insignificant. Mean serum IgA levels were also raised in TT, BL and LL subgroups but statistically the rise was not significant. In the BT subgroup, significantly low IgA levels were observed both compared to the control and the other leprosy subgroups. Immunoglobulin G levels were significantly raised only in the LL subgroups compared to the control and the other subgroups of leprosy patients. It is proposed that persistently raised gamma globulins and immunoglobulin G, A and M levels observed in lepromatous leprosy patients could be caused by macrophage blockade hindering the suppressor T-cell mediated homeostatic control for immunoglobulins.",

Bacillus subtilis did not show any reduction of growth rates in presence of ochratoxin A, but had a prolonged lag phase. With Staphylococcus pyogenes var. aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, a prolonged lag phase and a reduction of the growth rate was observed. Most sensitive was Streptococcus faecalis in the exponential-growth phase. The inhibition could be diminished by changing the pH to neutral, or by addition of yeast extract, tetrahydrofolate, or MgSO4. With MgSO4 a complete abolition of the inhibitory effect was achieved, but not with CaCl2. During growth inhibition, protein and RNA synthesis were reduced simultaneously, but not DNA synthesis.

The medium contains basal salts, vitamins, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, pyruvate, 0.05% l-cysteine, 0.05% glutathione, and a mixture of 20 additional amino acids, each of 0.01% final concentration, except serine, which was at 0.1%. The medium in shake culture at 37 degrees C with increased CO2 at pH 6.5, supports the maximum rate of growth, the highest cell yields, and the maximum cell surface antigen as distinguished by specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody. Studies during the development of this medium showed that CO2, pyruvate, and alpha-ketoglutarate strongly stimulated growth; that cysteine and methionine were required for growth; and that serine, threonine, histidine, tyrosine, and tryptophane were energy sources. Glutathione substituted for cysteine, but cystine did not. The organisms did not use glucose and polysaccharides, as judged by cell yields when these carbohydrates were present or absent. The chelators malate, citrate, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid totally inhibited growth. Beta-mercaptoethanol, thioglycolate, dithiothreitol, and Tween 80 (0.05%) inhibited growth strongly or completely. Catalase activity was extremely weak or absent. Morphology varied, depending upon conditions and phases of growth. In general, filamentous forms became chains of cigar-shaped bacilli fragmenting to pairs and becoming coccoidal in the late stationary pha-e of growth. The organism grew at 25, 30, and 37 degrees C. Although they varied in their growth characteristics, 10 isolates were passed for five transfers in the chemically defined broth, giving maximum rates of growth, cell yields, and antigen production.",

The multiplication of the three organisms was inhibited in the presence of oxygen whether the medium was at a negative oxidation-reduction potential (Eh of -50 mV), poised by the intermittent addition of dithiothreitol, or at a positive oxidation-reduction potential (Eh of near +500 mV). However, when these organisms were cultured in the presence of oxygen, no inhibition was observed, even when the oxidation-reduction potential was maintained at an average Eh of +325 mV by the addition of potassium ferricyanide. When the cultures were aerated, the growth patterns of the three organisms demonstrated different sensitivities to oxygen. P. magnus was found to be the most sensitive. After 2 h of aerobic incubation, no viable organisms could be detected. B. fragilis was intermediately sensitive to oxygen with no viable organisms detected after 5 h of aerobic incubation.

Fermentation in fermenters was run in three stages. The medium consisted of soy flour, glucose, ammonium sulfate and calcium carbonate; initial pH was 7.2 approximately 7.5, and temperature 25 degrees C. The course of fermentation was then modified to encourage maximal growth and eliminate the intermediate lag period observed in shake flasks. Useful corrections included continuous addition of soybean oil at 1.25 %/day and maintenance of pH at 6 by addition of ammonium hydroxide on demand. The ammonium hydroxide added also served as a rapidly utilized nitrogen source and could not be replace by NaOH or KOH. Under optimal conditions antimycin A was produced at constant rate from the second to the sixth day, when maximum yields of more than 9 g/liter were attained.

Penicillinase was measured at selected time intervals from supernates of cultures grown in Antibiotic Medium 3 broth containing various concentrations of salts or buffers or from supernates of cultures treated with lysostaphin and subsequently disrupted by French press treatment. Incubation of cells with media containing either sodium chloride (5, 10, and 15%), sodium citrate (5 and 10%), or organic buffers (Tris-HCl, 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5%; BES, 10 and 20%) resulted in a significant stimulation of the release of penicillinase when compared to control cells. It was also observed that pH 7.0-7.5 was optimal for penicillinase activity and release. From studies of enzymatic and mechanical disruption of cells, it was observed that an increase in ionic strength of the suspending medium to certain optimal levels appeared to stimulate the conversion of penicillinase to an extracellular form. Electron microscopic studies revealed that a large number of mesosomal vesicles seemed to be present in cells incubated for 4 hours in media containing various concentrations of sodium chloride. It is proposed that either appearance of vesicles or convolution of cell membrane, which may be caused by further synthesis of new membrane, is involved in stimulation of the synthesis and release of membrane-bound penicillinase.",

The effect of acetic acid was primarily a function of pH and the physiological state of the inoculum. At pH 4.5, acetic acid at a concentration of 1 g/l increased the specific growth rate, reduced time of cultivation and increased yield of the yeast dry weight. The yield from acetic acid was 61%. In the presence of a higher content of acetic acid (3--6 g/l) the yield was only 18--26%. The yield calculated only from monosaccharides increased but the yield with respect to total carbon sources was lower. The specific growth rate decreased as well. The addition of ethanol also resulted in an increase of the production and yield of the yeast dry weight but the cultivation time was prolonged. The simultaneous utilization of carbon sources of the studied mixture modelling a sulphite fermentation medium with ethanol is advantageous. However, due to physiology of the yeast, it is most suitable to cultivate a strain adapted to utilizable carbon sources in a continuous way, in the presence of their limiting concentrations in the cultivation medium.",

The dose was adjusted to the highest level failing to cause tachycardia (phentolamine: 0.19 to 0.76 mg/mn; nitroprusside: 0.07 mg/mn), and the treatment was maintained for between 5 hours and 8 days. Under these conditions, after one hour a diminution in mean arterial pressure can be observed (from 94 to 82 mmHg, p less than 0.005), as can a decrease in pulmonary arterial diastolic pressure (from 21 to 14 mmHg, p less than 0.001); the cardiac index rises slightly (from 3.1 to 3.51/mn/m2(NS), and the systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance are decreased by 20% and 30% respectively. The index of systolic work does not increase to a significant degree (30.7 to 32.9 g-m-syst-m2), the same work being carried out with smaller filling pressures. Together with the lessened resistance to ventricular ejection, and also, it seems, to a dedrease in venous tone, this beneficial effect has been particularly marked in a case of posterior papillary syndrome with mitral incompetence.

    "input": "Forty-seven patients receiving gold therapy for rheumatoid arthritis were observed sequentially at 6-monthly intervals. When the disease was in remission, and remained so, the in vitro responses of lymphocytes to phylohemagglutinin stimulation tended to be normal. Improvement in the disease were associated with improvement in lymphocyte response and deterioration associated with depression of response. Our observations suggest that these changes are a reflection of disease activity and their relationship to gold therapy is indirect.",
    "output": "When the disease (rheumatoid arthritis) was in remission, the in vitro responses of lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin stimulation tended to be normal. This indicates that the lymphocyte function, as measured by their response to this stimulus, improves when the disease is under control. However, it's important to note that the relationship between these changes and gold therapy is indirect, suggesting that the improvement in lymphocyte response is a reflection of the disease activity, not a direct effect of the gold therapy."

    "input": "Characteristics of patients on penicillamine therapy for rheumatoid arthritis were correlated with the occurrence of different side-effects. Patients developing proteinuria tended to have lower sheep-cell agglutination test titres prior to therapy, but no other correlations were found. It is postulated that rheumatoid factor reacts with immune complexes, causing their precipitation and reducing renal glomerular deposition and therefore the incidence of proteinuria. Penicillamine would surely be the first choice of anti-rheumatic therapy if it were not for its side-effects. It is capable of controlling the disease, but in many cases treatment must be interrupted because of some potentially serious side-effects, such as thrombocytopenia, rash or nephropathy. Understanding the mode of action of a drug may lead to the development of new and better compounds. Similarly, understanding the mechanism of the side-effects may lead to their elimination. This survey was designed to identify factors which influenced the development of particular side-effects in patients receiving penicillamine for rheumatoid arthritis.",
    "output": "The side-effect of penicillamine therapy associated with lower sheep-cell agglutination test titres prior to therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is proteinuria. This suggests that the development of proteinuria may be related to a lower prevalence of rheumatoid factor and immune complexes, which could potentially reduce the incidence of this side-effect."

Only free inhibitor was found in corresponding plasma. All plasminogen present in synovial fluid could be activated to plasmin upon addition of urokinase (24 nM/1). In those patients where enzyme-inhibitor complex in synovial fluid was present, a higher concentration of phase proteins in synovial fluid was found, indicating an increased degree of inflammation despite identical scores in the Lansbury clinical index in the two groups.

All four 2'-O-methylribonucleosides, but only two base-methylated derivatives, 7-methylguanosine (7MeG) and 6-methyladenosine (6MeA), were identified. 6MeA was the major component accounting for approximately 50% of the total methyl-labeled ribonucleosides. 7MeG, comprising about 10% of the total, was present exclusively at the 5' terminus of the poly(A)+ RNA and could be removed by periodate oxidation and beta elimination. Evidence for a 5' to 5' linkage of 7MeG to adjacent 2'-O-methylribonucleosides through at least two and probably three phosphates to give structures of the type 7MeG5'ppp5pNMep- and 7MeG5'ppp5'NMepNmep- was presented.

The specificity of transcription in this system by homologous RNA polymerases I and III has been investigated by gel electrophoresis, hybridization analysis, and RNase T1 mapping. Exogenous RNA polymerase I selectively transcribes rRNA genes. The transcription of these genes by polymerase I is 30- and 8-fold more selective than RNA polymerase III and Escherichia coli polymerase holoenzyme, respectively. Exogenous RNA polymerase III synthesized RNAs similar in size to authentic 5 S RNA, 4.5 S pre-tRNA, and 4 S tRNA. Eleven per cent of this RNA is 5 S RNA as determined by hybridization. Neither polymerase I nor E. coli polymerase synthesizes detectable quantities of RNA in this size range. AT1 ribonuclease digestion of 5 S RNA synthesized by exogenous RNA polymerase III acting on acid-treated chromatin gives a fragment pattern corresponding to that of 5 S RNA.

    "input": "At least three different transfer RNAs are produced by in vitro processing of 30S ribosomal RNA which accumulates in RNAase III- strains of E. coli. Two of these tRNAs, tRNAGlu2 and tRNAIle1, have previously been shown to be \"spacer tRNAs\"--that is, genes for their synthesis are located in rRNA transcription units between the cistrons for 16S and 23S rRNAs (Lund et al., 1976). The third tRNA whose sequences are contained in 30S rRNA is tRNAAla1B. In addition to the tRNAs, 5S rRNA and several other 4S fragments are produced. Some of these 4S fragments may represent additional spacer tRNAs. One fragment, about 70 nucleotides long, arises from the 5' end of the 17S precursor of 16S rRNA. Four or five other tRNAs are hydrogen-bonded to 30S rRNA as we prepare it; one or more of these tRNAs may also be a spacer tRNA. The enzymes that process tRNAs out of 30S rRNA are associated with ribosomes, but can be removed from them by washing in 0.2 M NH4Cl; the enzymes required for 5S rRNA processing remain bound to the 0.2 M NH4Cl-washed ribosomes.

Synthesis occurred preferentially in the presence of Mn2+ and at relatively high substrate and enzyme concentrations. No primer was required, and addition of oligo-U to a mRNA-dependent reaction gave no marked stimulation. Sedimentation analysis of cRNA made on different templates indicated that the products were mainly 2-4 S, but a fraction of the product was larger. Fingerprints of 32P-labelled cRNA made on 5 S rRNA and 18 S rRNA indicated that the complexity of the cRNAs was related to the size of the template, suggesting that a substantial portion of the templates were copied. This reaction provides a simple method for preparing cRNA of high specific activity for use in hybridisation studies, and possibly in sequence analysis. 32P-labelled cRNA made on 18 S and 28 S rRNA was a sensitive hybridisation probe for detection of the specific fragments of mouse DNA containing the rRNA genes.",

Polyadenylated rRNA was first synthesized using the enzyme ATP:polynucleotidyl transferase from mainze. Then in the presence of an oligonucleotide primer uniquely complementary to the end of each adenylated rRNA, a cDNA copy was produced using AMV reverse transcriptase. In every case, the cDNA transcript was of finite size, which we ascribe to the appearance of an oligonucleotide containing m62A near the 3' end of the 18S rRNAs. Sequences at the 3' termini of 18S rRNA molecules from the four eucaryotic species examined here (mouse, silk worm, wheat embryo and slime mold) are highly conserved. They also exhibit strong homology to the 3' end of E. coli 16S rRNA. Two important differences, however, are apparent. First, the 16S sequence CCUCC, implicated in mRNA binding by E. coli ribosomes, is absent from each eucaryotic rRNA sequence. Second, a purine-rich region which exhibits extensive complementarity to the 5' noncoding regions of many eucaryotic mRNAs appears consistently.",

Similar RNA duplexes were detected whether mRNA or virion RNA was the radioactive component and whether the mRNA was synthesized in vitro or in vivo. The sharp banding pattern of these RNA molecules was dependent on treatment with RNase T2, suggesting that removal of poly(A) is necessary. Identification of the coding region contained in each RNA duplex was based on their previous identification as single-stranded mRNA on formamide-containing, polyacrylamide gels. Because the two smallest mRNA'S had not been previously separated, their identification was based on their in vitro transcriptional gene order. In the order of increasing mobilities on the slab gels, the RNA duplexes are identified as the hybrid of the region of the genome RNA hybridized to the complementary mRNA coding for the large protein, the glycoprotein, the nucleocapsid protein, the core-associated NS protein, and the matrix protein (L,G,N,NS, and M). Several lines of evidence support the presence of undegraded complete mRNA, excluding poly(A), in these RNA duplexes. Also, the two smallest mRNA's, separated by duplex formation, were denatured, and their individual oligonucleotide fingerprints were determined.

The RNA molecules initiated and labeled in vivo and elongated in vitro were then selectively purified on a thiopropyl 6-B Sepharose affinity column. The procedure was shown to be free of artifacts since the addition of mercurated nucleotides and the retention on the affinity column is mediated by the endogenous RNA polymerase II (nucleoside triphosphate:RNA nucleotidyltransferase; EC 2.7.7.6), is sensitive to actinomycin D, and is dependent on the presence of all four ribonucleotide triphosphates. This general procedure was applied to the mapping of viral promoters late after adenovirus 2 infection of HeLa cells. RNA purified as described above was hybridized to restriction enzyme fragments attached to nitrocellulose filters. The 5' ends of the nascent RNA chains are located in coordinates 9.5-17 for a rightward transcript, 0-25 for a leftward transcript, and possibly 60-70 for a second rightward transcript.

The poly(A) mRNA, which comprises approximately 1.7% of the total cellular RNA, was further characterized by Sepharose 4B chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both techniques showed that the poly(A) mRNA was heterodisperse in size, with an average molecular weight similar to that of 17S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The poly(A) segments isolated from the poly(A) mRNA were relatively short, with three major size classes of 30, 55, and 70 nucleotides. Gel electrophoresis of the non-poly(A) RNA indicated that it contained primarily rRNA and 4S RNA.

All results have been quantified by computer analysis. The predictive value of the EEGs has been assessed in 2 ways: (1) by comparison with the pathology found after surgery and (2) by the long-term clinical status of the patient postoperatively. Twelve cases with lesions found in limbic structures and 6 with cortical involvement are reported. In the latter cases secondary firing of the hippocampus, with its low threshold for seizures, frequently followed, though more rapidly than could be timed by visual inspection alone. Bilateral signs both in scalp EEGs and in depth were a common finding in the cases with limbic lesions.

Thirty-two right-handed adults each performed 30 trials, lasting 6-15 sec each, of four simplified, controlled tasks: mental rotation of geometric forms, serial addition of a column of signed digits, substitution of letters with subsequent word recognition and visual fixation. The first three tasks could not be differentiated from each other. Each of these tasks could be differentiated from visual fixation by approximately 10% generalized reductions in alpha and beta band intensities, and slight increases in theta band intensities frontally and occipitally. We conclude that the EEG patterns which differentiated the complex tasks described in Part I were due to inter-task differences in stimulus characteristics, efferent activities and/or performance-related factors, rather than to cognitive differences.

Computer analysis of the EEG was made by (a) an on-line automatic EEG analyser yielding measures of mean power, mean frequency and frequency spread (complexity) and (b) an off-line period-amplitude (P-A) analysis, which gave per cent activity time and mean voltage in 21 frequency bands. As compared to auditory rest the auditory memory test gave an amplitude increase frontally in the alpha, theta, and delta bands. During the visual reasoning test there was in addition an amplitude increase in the alpha band in the temporal region. During the auditory test a tendency to a decrease of the alpha activity was seen in all three regions but this decrease occurred only occipitally during the visual test.

    "input": "An attempt was made at using a small computer to recognize and quantify interictal epileptic activity (spikes and sharp waves) in the human scalp EEG. To perform the automatic recognition, the EEG of each channel is broken down into half-waves. A half-wave is characterized by its duration and its amplitude relative to the background activity. A wave is characterized by the durations and amplitudes of its two component half-waves, by the second derivative at its apex measured relative to the background activity, and by the duration and amplitude of the following half-wave. Particular combinations of these parameters were found to characterize spikes and sharp waves and are used for their recognition and quantification. Specific methods are used for the rejection of spike-like or sharp wave-like wave forms such as eye blinks, muscle potentials and sharp alpha activity and were found to perform with a high level of reliability. Interchannel relationships are thoroughly examined to determine areas of maximal epileptogenicity. Sixteen channels can be analyzed in real time. Results are presented in a simple picture containing localizing and quantitative information. Specific questions regarding the time relationships of spikes in different channels can be asked interactively by the user. The system is of potential use in clinical electroencephalography.",

    "input": "Simultaneous magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded from six normal adult subjects. MEG signal strength and EEG voltage level appear to be linearly correlated. Spectral analysis suggested that the MEG and EEG data were produced by similar but non-identical generator systems. A vertex region magnetic averaged evoked response to flash was recorded in one (of four) subjects, consisting of a waveform similar to but out of phase with the simultaneous EEG averaged evoked response, such that cortical negativity was correlated with a magnetic field directed into the scalp. Eye movement artifact, which can seriously compromise EEG recordings, does not appear to be a major problem in MEG recordings.",

    "input": "This study is carried out on single (not averaged) recordings combining the spontaneous activity preceding the stimulus onset and the EP recorded upon acoustical stimulation. These recordings, which we call EEG-EPograms, are measured simultaneously from different subdural brain structures, such as the auditory cortex, medial geniculate nucleus, inferior colliculus, reticular formation and the hippocampus of awake cats. Using a combined analysis procedure (C.A.P.), the relevant frequency components of spontaneous EEG and EPs, recorded simultaneously from these brain nuclei, are analyzed according to the consistent selectivity bands depicted by the determined amplitude-frequency characteristics. These analyses provide us the following information: (1) there is an important congruency in the time courses of simultaneous response components in common frequency bands, especially in the alpha and beta frequency ranges; (2) there exist significant coupling and synchrony between the evoked amplitude enhancements in the simultaneously recorded single response components; (3) the inter-nuclei coherency in the brain's electrical activity is enormously increased upon stimulation; (4) the evoked response magnitude can be predicted, with reasonable accuracy, from the spontaneous activity preceding the stimulation. The strong dependence of the response magnitude on the stimulus-preceding EEG is explained by means of a model network consisting of a population of relaxation oscillators, which can be brought to different states of synchrony and asynchrony. Some suggestions and comments are also made for investigators working toward theories of signal transmission in the brain.",

Significant intra- and interhemispheric differences in the peak frequencies within the alpha band were observed, up to 0.8 c/sec. Local modality -dependent increases in the peak frequency were also observed, which were predominant in occipital areas during visual stimulation and in central regions during acoustic stimulation. In most cases an increase in the peak frequency occurred together with a marked decrease in power, which could be interpreted as a desynchronization of slow components within the alpha band. These peak frequency differences found in the scalp EEG lead to the assumption that there might also be different alpha rhythms at the level of the cortex.",

To confirm and extend these findings, EPs to left and right median nerve stimuli, visual pattern flashes (VEPs), and auditory clicks (AEPs) were recorded from 14 locations in 86 patients and 33 controls. Three sets of analyses compared different patient groups with age- and sex-matched controls. The results confirmed previous SEP findings in chronic schizophrenics; no other subject group displayed the combination of high early and low late SEP stability. The SEP results did not generalize to VEPs and AEPs. Lead location was important for group differences. In overt schizophrenics, late epoch stability was low in all EPs. The results suggest certain limitations to the hypothesis of an impaired subcortical filtering mechanism in chronic schizophrenics.",

These were recorded from 14 locations in both the patient and control groups.

    "input": "A spatio-temporal analysis of the successive and simultaneous components of the pattern-evoked potential recorded on the scalp, and of their modifications according to which part of the visual field is stimulated, was carried out with 20 'normal' subjects, in order to shed some light on their most probable sites of origin. The stimulus consisted in the onset of a 20 degree checkerboard presented in runs of 75 stimuli each. Its duration was 750 msec and its frequency of occurrence was random (about 1 every 1500 msec). Twelve different visual field situations were recorded: whole field, half fields and quadrants and stimuli limited to the fovea, to the macula and to extramacular areas. Data were collected from 9 active electrodes (in line, forming a cross montage), and various reference electrodes (ear lobes, Fz, non-cephalic). Eye movements were simultaneously recorded. The electrophysiological data were digitized on line and processed by computer in the form of averaged spatio-temporal maps. In addition to the classical posterior components which peak on the midline (N 60, N 140, and P 200) or less than 4 cm away on both sides (P 90), a late negative wave (LN 210) was differentiated which peaked lower than the inion and more than 8 cm away from the midline on both hemispheres. The large inter-individual variability of the spatio-temporal organization of these components under the same conditions, as well as its very good intra-individual reproducibility, were emphasized. Interpreted on the basis of a simple dipole sheet model of the visual cortex, the changes observed for each component in the 12 experimental situations led to the following suggestions: only the first component N 60 could reflect the activity of the part of area 17 emerging on the convexity, whereas P 90 (Jeffreys' CI) is more likely to originate in area 19 and the midline components N 140 and P 200 in area 18. The topography and reactivity of LN 210 could fit with the hypothesis that it reflects activity of the infero-temporal cortex.",

    "input": "1 Differentiation of the roles of histamine H1- and H2-receptors in the mediation of the effects of histamine on the isolated working heart of the guinea-pig was achieved through the use of histamine and selective histamine receptor agonists and antagonists. 2 Histamine over the dose range 10(-9) mol to 10(-6) mol produced dose-related increases in sinus rate, left intraventricular pressure (LVP)max, LVdP/dtmax, coronary flow, aortic flow, total cardiac output and external pressure-volume work. 3 Dimaprit, a selective histamine H2-receptor agonist, produced very similar responses to histamine. 4 2-Pyridylethylamine, a selective histamine H1-receptor agonist, had little effect on cardiac function unless large doses were administered. Such doses produced increases in all measured parameters. 5 Cimetidine, a selective histamine H2-receptor antagonist, antagonized the effects of histamine and dimaprit and some but not all effects of 2-pyridylethylamine. In the presence of cimetidine a decrease in all parameters with the exception of sinus rate was observed with both histamine and 2-pyridylethylamine. 6 The selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist, mepyramine, had little effect on responses to all three agonists. However, the depressant effects observed with histamine and 2-pyridylethylamine in the presence of cimetidine were antagonized by mepyramine. 7 The results indicate the important role of the histamine H2-receptor in the mediation of the gross cardiac effects of histamine and also indicate that histamine H1-receptors can mediate cardiac depression.",

This suggests that while histamine H1-receptors may have a lesser role in mediating the effects of histamine on cardiac function under normal conditions, they can mediate cardiac depression when large doses are administered."

The method is based on the antagonism of the histamine-induced, and the spontaneous, gastric acid secretion in the stomach-perfused, urethane-anesthetized acute rat. For the induced gastric acid secretion, the animal received two consecutive equal injections of histamine (2 mg/kg, intrajugularly), the second 1.7 h after the termination of the first histamine-induced acid hypersecretion. Atropine (5 mg/kg), chlorisondamine (2 mg/kg), imipramine (10 mg/kg) and tripelennamine (5 mg/kg), administered i.p., failed to inhibit the histamine-induced, or the spontaneous, gastric acid secretion. Metiamide inhibited the histamine-induced acid secretion (ED50 1.85 mg/kg, i.p.) and the spontaneous acid secretion (10 mg/kg, i.p.). These results suggest that in the rat model employed in this study, histamine and H2-receptors play a very important role in the regulation of the gastric acid secretion. Other mechanisms involving cholinergic tone, biogenic amine uptake and histamine H1-receptors do not seem to intervene.",

    "instruction": "What type of receptors does histamine act on to cause impairment of sympathetic nerve function to the myocardium?",
    "input": "A study was designed to investigate the effect of histamine on sympathetic transmission to the myocardium in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Intravenous infusion of histamine (1.0 and 2.0 microgram/kg/min) produced dose-related decreases in blood pressure and caused significant impairment of cardioacceleration observed during stimulation of the right postganglionic cardiac sympathetic nerve fibers. Positive chronotropic effects of intravenously administered norepinephrine as well as tyramine were not altered during histamine infusion. Blockade of neuronal reuptake with desipramine did not modify the inhibitory action of histamine on sympathetic nerve function. Prior administration of mepyramine (pyrilamine), a histamine type H1-receptor antagonist caused partial attenuation of the depressor action of histamine, but did not prevent histamine-induced inhibition of neurogenic function. Further treatment with metiamide, a histamine type H2-receptor antagonist caused nearly complete attenuation of the depressor response to histamine and also significantly antagonized the inhibitory action of histamine on sympathetic transmission to the myocardium. It is concluded that while the depressor action of histamine is due to the activation of both H1- as well as H2-receptors, histamine causes impairment of sympathetic nerve function to the myocardium by acting on H2-receptors which may be located on sympathetic nerve terminals.",

    "input": "1 In the rat the decrease in blood pressure caused by histamine involves activation of both H1- and H2-receptors. Since arterial pressure measurements alone do not permit the separation of responses into cardiac and vascular components, the following experiments were undertaken to study vascular histamine receptors. 2 Vascular responses were studied in the autoperfused hindquarters of anaesthetized rats. Intra-arterial histamine caused vasodilatation which was only partially attenuated by treatment with mepyramine, an H1-receptor antagonist. Treatment with metiamide, the H2-receptor antagonist, did not affect vasodilatation caused by histamine but did attenuate vasodilatation which persisted after mepyramine. 3 Intra-arterial 4-methylhistamine, an H2-receptor agonist, caused vasodilatation which was reduced by metiamide. The H1-receptor agonist, 2-(2-pyridyl)ethylamine also caused vasodilatation which was blocked by mepyramine. 4 It is concluded that in the rat, histamine causes vasodilatation mediated by both H1- and H2-receptors.",
    "output": "The effect of metiamide on vasodilatation caused by histamine in the autoperfused hindquarters of anesthetized rats is that it does not affect the vasodilatation caused by histamine itself. However, metiamide does attenuate the persisting vasodilatation that remains after treatment with mepyramine, an H1-receptor antagonist. Furthermore, metiamide reduces the vasodilatation caused by 4-methylhistamine, an H2-receptor agonist. This suggests that in rats, histamine causes vasodilatation through both H1- and H2-receptors, and metiamide primarily acts on H2-receptors."

    "input": "The role of histamine as a mediator of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction was examined in intact anesthetized dogs. Antagonism of histamine vasoconstrictor (H1) receptors with a classic antihistaminic drug (chlorpheniramine) failed to prevent or modify the pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia (10% O2). Blockade of histamine vasodilator (H2) receptors with a newly synthesized blocking agent (metiamide) potentiated the vasoconstriction induced by hypoxia and prevented the normal increase in heart rate. Combined H1- and H2-receptor blockade also did not prevent or reduce the hypoxic pulmonary pressor response, although it did effectively abolish the cardiovascular actions of infused histamine. In other dogs, histamine infused (3.6 mug/kg per min) during hypoxia attenuated the pulmonary vasoconstriction induced by hypoxia. The results imply that, in the dog, histamine does not mediate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. However, histamine does appear to be released during hypoxia, and it may play a role in modulating the pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia by opposing the hypoxia induced vasoconstriction. The results also imply that histamine may be responsible for the increase in heart rate during hypoxia.",

However, histamine does appear to be released during hypoxia and may play a role in modulating the pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia by opposing the hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction.

Interestingly, blockade of histamine H2 receptors potentiated the vasoconstriction induced by hypoxia and prevented the normal increase in heart rate, while infused histamine attenuated the pulmonary vasoconstriction induced by hypoxia."

    "input": "Histamine has been shown to inhibit a variety of immune responses including the antigen-induced, IgE mediated, release of histamine from sensitized human leucocytes and from sensitized monkey and dog mast cells. The inhibitory action of histamine appears to be mediated by action at a histamine H2-receptor. In in vitro experiments the H2-receptor antagonist metiamide has been shown to block this histamine effect and it has been suggested that H2-receptor antagonists could intensify immediate hypersensitivity reactions in vivo. The effects of the H2-receptor antagonist metiamide and cimetidine have been studied in in vitro and in vivo models of anaphylaxis in the guinea-pig. The amount of extracellular histamine found after antigen challenge is greater when an H2-receptor antagonist is present during the incubation of mast cells with antigen. Bronchoconstriction induced by antigen in sensitized guinea-pig is exacerbated only by high doses of cimetidine. Possible explanations for the mechanism of action involved are discussed.",

    "input": "In pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs, infusion of a low dose of histamine directly into the third ventricle increased plasma ACTH concentration. The increase was unaffected by metiamide, a drug which blocks H2 receptors, but was abolished by mepyramine, a drug which blocks H1 receptors. Mepyramine alone did not produce a decrease in plasma ACTH concentration in stressed dogs. Infusion of the H1 agonist 2-methylhistamine increased plasma ACTH concentration, whereas infusion of the H2 agonist 4-methylhistamine decreased plasma ACTH concentration and blocked the response to surgical stress. Histamine, 2-methylhistamine and 4-methylhistamine had no statistically significant effect on plasma renin activity, blood pressure, or heart rate, and histamine had no effect on plasma prolactin concentration. There were no consistent, specific effects on growth hormone secretion. We conclude that activation of central H1 receptors increases ACTH secretion in dogs, and that activation of central H2 receptors decreases ACTH secretion. Some of the reported effects of cyproheptadine and other drugs on ACTH secretion may be due to their antihistamine activity.",

    "input": "Chopped lung and isolated leukocytes of calves sensitized to horse plasma release histamine when incubated with the antigen. Low concentrations (10(-9) and 10(-8) M) of exogenous histamine enhanced both spontaneous and antigen-induced histamine release. The enhancement of antigen-induced histamine release was inhibited by metiamide but not by mepyramine, whereas the enhancement of spontaneous histamine release was not significantly affected by either histamine antagonist. At higher concentrations of exogenous histamine (10(-6) to 10(-4) M), uptake and metabolism significantly interfered with the method. These results indicate the existence in bovine lung and leukocyte of a positive feedback mechanism which regulates histamine release via an H2-receptor. This is in direct contrast to the reported situation in the human leukocyte, and suggests that histamine fulfils an important role in the intrinsic control of allergic reactions in cattle.",
    "output": "The type of receptor involved in the positive feedback mechanism that regulates histamine release in bovine lung and leukocytes is an H2-receptor.

    "instruction": "What is the effect of H2 antihistamines on histamine-induced inhibition of histamine release and cyclic AMP levels?",
    "input": "Antigen-induced, IgE-mediated release of histamine from human basophiles is an in vitro model of allergic reacttions; it is blocked by extracellular histamine, presumably as a result of its ability to increase adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) levels. The H1 antihistamines do not antagonize these effects of histamine but at approximately equal to 1 mM cause histamine release and at approximately equal to 0.1mM inhibit antigen-induced histamine release. The phenothiazine antihistamines are 10-30 fold more potent inhibitors than the rest; other tricyclic antidepressant drugs share this activity. The mechanism of this inhibition, which occurs in both the 1 degree and 2 degree stages of histamine release, is not known but it is not due to partial agonist activity since the anti-H1 drugs cause a significant fall in cyclic AMP levels. The anti-anaphylactic effects of the H1 antagonists probably play no therapeutic role but we suggest that drugs structurally similar to the phenothiazine antihistamines should be developed for clinical testing. The H2 antihistamines block histamine-induced inhibition of histamine release and the increase in cyclic AMP levels, but neither cause nor inhibit histamine release. The K-B values for the anti-H2 drugs (burimamide approximately equal to 5 muM); metiamide approximately equal to 0.5muM); are similar to those described for other H2 receptors.",
    "output": "The H2 antihistamines do not cause nor inhibit histamine release in human basophils, but they block the inhibition of histamine release and the increase in cyclic AMP levels that are induced by histamine. This suggests that H2 antihistamines interact with H2 receptors to counteract the effects of histamine on these specific pathways. However, the exact mechanism of this interaction is not known."

The H1 blockers conferred partial protection which shows that with the experimental protocol utilized (challenge injection with high doses of antigen), histamine plays a lesser role than other mediators released or synthesized. Metiamide (30.0 mg/kg i.v.) noticeably enhanced the increase in pulmonary resistance observed during anaphylactic reaction and reduced the protective effect of the H1 antagonists on this parameter and on histamine release. These effects might be explained by an inhibition - at least partial - of the negative feed-back mechanism through which histamine controls its own release, or by a specific action of metiamide in high doses. The transient tachycardia initially observed in anaphylactic shock is partly related to stimulation of cardiac H2 receptors by the histamine released, since it is suppressed by metiamide.",
    "output": "The possible explanation for metiamide's enhancement of the increase in pulmonary resistance during anaphylactic reaction could be due to an inhibition, at least partial, of the negative feedback mechanism through which histamine controls its own release. Alternatively, it could be due to a specific action of metiamide in high doses. This is suggested because metiamide, a H2 receptor antagonist, noticeably enhances the increase in pulmonary resistance observed during anaphylactic reaction and reduces the protective effect of H1 antagonists, while it suppresses the transient tachycardia initially observed in anaphylactic shock, which is related to stimulation of cardiac H2 receptors by histamine."

Serum TSH was found to decrease significantly after 5 hours of haemofiltration possibly by losses via the haemofiltrate. Stimulation of the pituitary gland by i.v. injection of 200 microgram TRH gave a normal TSH response.

Compared to age and sex matched control subjects, these patients had significantly lower mean total serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations (T4; 69.1+/-22.2 nmol/1; (mean+/-SD) vs. 100.1+/-19.1, P less than 0.001; T13; 1.61+/-0.47 nmol/1 vs. 1.76+/-0.34, P less than 0.025), lower free thyroxine index (FTI), (FTI; 66.1+/-22.4 vs. 95.1+/-20.2, P less than 0.001), and higher basal serum thyrotrophin (TSH) concentrations (TSH; 7.6+/-10.7 mU/1 vs. 3.8+/-1.5, P less than 0.001). These changes were not related to age or sex. Abnormalities in one or more test of thyroid function were demonstrated in at least 38 (46%) of the 82 patients. Two main patterns of abnormality were defined: 1) subnormal T4, FTI and elevated basal TSH levels (primary hypothyroidism) in 13 (16%). All seven of the 13 patients in whom TRH tests were performed showed the expected exaggerated TSH response, and seven out of the 13 patients (54%) had positive thyroid antibodies, 2) Subnormal T4, subnormal or low normal FTI, and basal TSH levels within the normal range in 18 (22%). The mean basal TSH concentration was, however, significantly higher than in patients with normal T4 and FTI levels, suggesting a minor degree of thyroid failure. Only two of the 18 patients (11%) had positive thyroid antibodies. Of the 17 patients in the group tested, 13 showed a normal TSH response to TRH, three an exagerrated response (all females), and one had an impaired response. Other patterns of abnormal thyroid function were observed occasionally: one female patient had biochemical T3 toxicosis; another had the biochemical pattern of subclinical hypothyroidism, four patients with normal basal T4, FTI and TSH levels showed an exaggerated TSH response to TRH and one patient had an impaired response. These data indicate that htyroid dysfunction, in particular hypothyroidism, is common in adults with Down's syndrome, though specific tests are usually required to make the diagnosis. The general reduction in thyroid function in Down's syndrome may be due to impaired development of the thyroid gland. However, frank chemical hypothyroidism may occur only when thyroiditis is superimposed on preexisting diminished thyroid reserve.",

    "instruction": "What was the age range of the young hyperthyroid patients in the study?",
    "input": "In 65 elderly hyperthyroid patients (age range 50-78 years), sex differences, signs and symptoms and thyroid function were studied and the data were compared with those on 48 young hyperthyroid patients (age range 20-29 years). The incidence of hyperthyroidism was 3.5 times higher in females than in males among the young patients, whereas it was approximately equal in males and females among the elderly patients. Signs and symptoms conformed with the textbook description in the young subjects but not in the elderly ones. Measurements of serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) proved useful in preventing false diagnoses in elderly patients with atypical symptoms. In some elderly subjects with marginal increases of serum T3 and T4 concentrations, measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) after administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was required to achieve an accurate diagnosis. Serum T3 and T4 levels and the thyroidal uptake of radioiodine were slightly but not significantly lower in the elderly than in the young patients. A high titer of circulating thyroid auto-antibody in the elderly may be related to this slight decrease in thyroid function. Serum T3 levels were significantly lower in the elderly than in the young subjects; this suggests impairment of peripheral monodeiodination of T4. Any abnormal serum levels of T4, T3, and TSH before and after administration of TRH could easily be restored to normal by treatment with antithyroid drugs in the elderly patients.",

The serum triiodothyronine/thyroxine ratio (T3/T4) was greater than 20 ng/microgram in Graves' disease but less than 20 in all patients with subacute thyroiditis and 9 of 11 patients with autoimmune thyroiditis. Thus, like radioactive iodine uptake, the serum T3/T4 ratio is useful for differentiating destruction-induced thyrotoxicosis from the stimulation-induced hyperthyroidism of Graves' disease.",

    "instruction": "What percentage of non-HD patients had TT(3) levels in the hypothyroid range?",
    "input": "Thyroid function was evaluated in 46 patients with end-stage kidney disease and 42 normal subjects. Patients were studied before and after the institution of maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and after renal transplantation (RT). Serum total triiodothyronine concentrations (TT(3), ng/100 ml, mean+/-SD) were 63+/-17 and 83+/-22 in the non-HD and HD groups, respectively. Values from normal subjects were 128+/-25 and from RT patients 134+/-20. The TT(3) was in the hypothyroid range (<78 ng/100 ml; 2 SD below normal mean) in 80% of non-HD and 43% of HD patients. Mean serum total thyroxine concentration (TT(4)), although within the normal range, was lower than the control value. T(4)-binding globulin capacity was also slightly lower but the difference was not statistically significant. Among patients whose TT(4) was 1 SD below the normal mean, the free T(4) index was equally depressed, suggesting that factors other than decreased binding capacity might be responsible for the low TT(4). In addition, there was a 37% incidence of goiter. Mean serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was not elevated and the TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was distinctly blunted, suggesting the possibility of pituitary dysfunction as well. In vivo (125)I-l-T(4) and (131)I-l-T(3) kinetics during 0.2 mg/day of l-T(4) replacement showed marked reduction in T(3) turnover rate in the uremic patients, both before and during HD; the values (mug T(3)/day, mean+/-SD) for the different groups were as follows: normal, 33.8+/-6.1; non-HD, 13.5+/-2.6; HD, 12.9+/-3.1; and RT, 30.3+/-7.1. The low T(3) turnover rate was due to impaired extrathyroidal conversion of T(4) to T(3). The mean percent+/-SD of metabolized T(4) converted to T(3) was 37.2+/-5.8 in normal subjects, 15.7+/-3.1 in non-HD, 12.8+/-1.7 in HD, and 34.0+/-14.7 in RT patients. In contrast, thyroidal T(3) secretion rate was not different between the control and the three patient groups. Thus, it appears that uremia affects thyroid function at several levels: (a) subnormal pituitary TSH response to TRH; (b) possible intrathyroidal abnormalities as suggested by slightly decreased TT(4) and high incidence of goiter; and (c) abnormal peripheral generation of T(3) from T(4). Restoration of renal function with RT resulted in normalization of all parameters of thyroid function with the exception of blunted or absent TSH response to TRH. The latter may be a direct consequence of glucocorticoid administration.",

After treatment for one month there was either a normalization of laboratory tests either a subnormal thyroid function associated with an absence of response to TRH.

    "instruction": "What type of cells do not express FOCMA, even when they are infected with FeLV?",
    "input": "In cats, horizontally transmitted viruses cause leukemia and lymphoma under natural conditions. As with other retroviruses, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) contains products of 3 major genes; the virus core gag gene products, the polymerase, and the virus envelope glycoprotein. When cells are transformed in vitro by the related feline sarcoma virus (FeSV), an additional protein, FOCMA is expressed at the cell membrane. FOCMA, which is FeSV-coded, is transformation and/or tumor specific and expressed regardless of whether or not the cells make virus or contain virus structural antigens. Lymphoid leukemia cells also express FOCMA, both when FeLV is used to induce the disease in laboratory cats and when the tumors occur under natural conditions. FOCMA is expressed on both T and B lymphoid leukemia cells, but not expressed on non-malignant lymphoid cells, even when they are infected with FeLV. About one-third of the naturally occurring lymphoid tumors of cats lack detectable FeLV proteins and varying portions of the FeLV provirus. Despite this, they regularly express FOCMA, which is the target of an immuno-surveillance response that functions effectively under most conditions. FOCMA thus provides a useful model for antigens that might be expressed in \"virus-negative\" leukemias of man.",

    "instruction": "What titre of serum antibody levels to feline leukaemia virus associated cell membrane antigens indicates that a cat is unlikely to suffer any ill effects from the infection?",
    "input": "Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection is common among cats where contact is high. The virus can be transmitted readily between cats. It causes a variety of haemopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms; the most common types are alimentary, multicentric and thymic lymphosarcoma and lymphatic leukaemia. The virus is involved in the aetiology of certain other diseases including anaemia, glomerulonephritis and an immunosuppressive syndrome which predisposes cats to intercurrent infections. Many infected cats mount an immune response and do not suffer from any of these. The immune status is shown by serum antibody levels to feline leukaemia virus associated cell membrane antigens. Cats with a titre of 32 or more are most unlikely to suffer any ill effects and may eliminate the virus infection. The outcome of infection in an individual cat depends on the immunological competence of the cat, the dose of virus received and its ability to induce immunosuppression. FeLV infection can be detected by examination of tissues by electron microscopy, and by culture of virus from plasma and other tissues. In the United States, a method is now in use for the detection of leukaemia virus antigen in peripheral blood leukocytes; this is carried out on ordinary blood films. Successful prototype vaccines have been developed against FeLV. This paper describes the natural history of the virus, the diseases in which it is implicated and discusses recently developed diagnostic methods.",
    "output": "A titre of 32 or more in serum antibody levels to feline leukaemia virus associated cell membrane antigens indicates that a cat is most unlikely to suffer any ill effects from the infection. This is because cats with high antibody titres have developed an immune response to the virus and are able to eliminate the infection. However, it's important to note that the outcome of infection in an individual cat also depends on the immunological competence of the cat, the dose of virus received, and its ability to induce immunosuppression."

    "input": "Traditionally, cancer has not been considered an infectious disease although some multiple cases of leukemia in man and cattle have been reported. The discovery that feline lymphosarcoma was associated with an RNA virus (feline leukemia virus(FeLV)) meant that infectious transmission of the disease was a possibility. The critical question was whether the predominant method of transmission from one animal to another was 'vertical' (via the gametes) or 'horizontal' (via contagion or infection). A number of epidemiological studies have shown that the chances of healthy cats contracting lymphosarcoma are greatly increased when a cat with the disease lives in close proximity. It does not matter whether the healthy cats are related to the sick animal or not. It has also been established that viremic normal cats have an approximately 900 times greater chance of developing leukemia than cats whose FeLV status is unknown. Infectious FeLV is present in the excretions and blood of viremic animals. In the natural environment, feline lymphosarcoma occurs in clusters. The results in pet cats have been supported by experiments with cat colonies under controlled conditions and prove that horizontal transmission of FeLV occurs. This does not mean that epigenetic (infection in utero or via the milk) or vertical transmission cannot also occur. It should be possible to break the cycle of horizontal transmission of the virus by vaccination and thus control FeLV-related diseases.",
    "output": "In the context provided, it is stated that viremic normal cats have an approximately 900 times greater chance of developing leukemia than cats whose FeLV (Feline Leukemia Virus) status is unknown.

Electrophoretic analysis showed a major protein of mol. wt. about 24,000 (p24) which reacted in gel diffusion and complement-fixation tests with sera from naturally infected cattle, experimentally infected sheep, and guinea pigs immunized with p24. BLV p24 has an isoelectric point of 8-6. Interspecies antigenic reactivities characteristic of mammalian Type C virus p30s were not detected in disrupted BLV or on p24. Sheep and guinea pig antisera to BLV, reactive with p24, also did not precipitate several Type C virus p30s in radioimmunoassays. BLV is also distinguished from Type C viruses and resembles mouse mammary tumour virus and Mason-Pfezer virus in having an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase which is preferentially active in the presence of Mg++ when synthetic templates are used. Along with previously published morphological data, the above indicates that BLV is not a Type C virus as classically defined. Four hundred and forty one human sera from cancer patients and matched controls were non-reactive with disruped BLV, BLV infected cells, and BLV p24 in complement-fixation tests.",

In the latter case, antibodies to bovine leukemia virus antigens reached maximal values at the animal death in the tumor phase of the disease.

Using modern methods of clinical investigation, it is possible to make the diagnosis during the patient's life. Laparoscopy, permitting biopsy under direct vision, is the best investigation but it is not always possible. A search for alpha 1 foeto-protein was positive in one third of cases and the demonstration by hepatic arteriography of characteristic vascular abnormalities and, perhaps in future, information supplied by ultra-sonic echography, usually permit one to make the diagnosis.

In 8 patients, biopsy only occurred secondarily, during liver disease which appeared during antituberculous treatment. In five cases, the association of rifamycin and isoniazid was probably responsible and the mild histological signs noted suggested a favourable course after stopping one of the drugs or simply reducing the dose. The 3 other patients had virus hepatitis and biopsy was of prognostic interest by revealing the onset of post-hepatic cirrhosis. In 92 cases, liver biopsy was carried out before treatment. In 34 cases the liver was normal, in 38 patients there were hisotlogical changes which did not suggest tuberculosis but, probably, alcoholism. These were : steatosis, in 21 cases, cirrhosis in 8 cases, a mixture of steatosis and cirrhosis in 4 cases, and acute alcoholic hepatitis in 5 cases. Finally, in 20 cases, biopsy revealed an appearance of granulomatous hepatitis. Although this lesion is significant in the development of the disease, it is not characteristic of tuberculosis unless there is caseous necrosis, as in 2 cases, and unless culture of the biopsy material is positive, as in one case out of 9, i.e. the diagnostic interest of liver biopsy is not very great compared with prognostic interest. By determining the anatomical condition of the liver, often not obvious when simple liver function tests are carried out, it permits one to forsee to some extent the tolerance of the liver to antituberculous treatment, especially in alcoholics.",

Chronic alcoholics should be routinely evaluated for the presence of altered liver function and structure. Clearance of indocyanine green using dichromatic ear densitometry and computer and analysis provides a simple and sensitive method for mass screening of such patients. Clinical studies of lymphocyte reactivity to purified alcoholic hyaline may be valuable in recognizing alcoholic hepatitis, the precursor of cirrhosis. Ethanol toxicity, malnutrition and constitutional factors contribute to the development of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in alcoholics. Ethanol and/or acetaldehyde and the supernatant from lymphocytes stimulated by alcoholic hyaline cause a significant increase in the incorporation of proline into collagen of the damaged liver. Abstinence and correction of nutrient deficits are the cornerstones of treatment for alcoholic liver disease; a daily meal and dietary supplements should be provided for those with liver injury who continue to imbibe. Alcoholics with progressive liver disease despite supportive therapy may be aided by pharmacologic agents which suppress immunologic response and reduce fibrogenesis.",

The time of first manifestation of the disease was known because all patients had been in hospital or under serial outpatient observation, with clinical and biopsy studies every six months for chronic hepatitis. In addition, diagnosis of the liver cirrhosis was confirmed by laparoscopy and histomorphology, which further confirmed the exact timing of first manifestation. In 37 patients (32.5%) the disease healed out completely by way of reactionless fibrosis after, in some of them, a long period of observation, while in 47 (41.2%) the active disease continued, and 30 (26.3%) died in liver coma or bleeding from varices or surgical shunt procedures or from carcinoma of the liver. Prognosis of cirrhosis of the liver is thus much better than previously thought.",

    "input": "Liver biopsies from 60 patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH) developing against the background of steatosis, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis were studied histologically, histochemically and electron microscopically. AAH is characterized by necrosis of hepatocytes with deposition of alcoholic hyalin, obesity of the organ, and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration. Hyperplasia of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the appearance of megamitochondria, and an increased amount of peroxisomes reflect the participation of MEOS and the catalase system in alcohol metabolism with a progressive decrease in the activity of alcoholdehydrogenase. Acute alcoholic hepatitis is a connecting link between steatosis and cirrhosis of the liver in which the accompanying autoimmune mechanism and microcirculation disorder followed by activation of lipofibroblasts are conducive to the progression of the pathologic process.",

This condition is a result of excessive alcohol consumption, which leads to an increase in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the appearance of megamitochondria, and an increased amount of peroxisomes in the liver. These changes reflect the participation of microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS) and the catalase system in alcohol metabolism, with a progressive decrease in the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase.

Clinically, these patients presented with signs and symptoms compatible with cirrhosis and, of the 16 autopsy cases only 2 had been diagnosed correctly. In all but 4 cases, the noncancerous parenchyma showed advanced cirrhosis of the mixed type, with irregularly sized multilobular nodules and thin strands of stroma, different from typical alcoholic cirrhosis. The primary lesion was grossly encapsulated in the majority, suggesting a slow, expanding growth. Histologically, most primaries were relatively well differentiated. Serum alpha-fetoprotein was generally low, and it served as the major diagnostic clue in only 5 cases. In patients with mildly abnormal alpha-fetoprotein levels, continuous monitoring seems important in order to detect a steady rise, the first warning for tumor growth.",

    "input": "Six oncogenic cell lines were established from primary sarcomas that had been induced in thymectomized, aged, BALB/cSt mice by the injection of 3-methylcholanthrene. Of these lines, three produced B-tropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV), i.e. MuLV that would patently infect fibroblasts of BALB/c origin but not those from NIH Swiss mice. One of these lines, M-138, produced large quantities of virus, permitting the isolation of milligram quantities of B-tropic MuLV. Neonatal BALB/c mice injected with the M-138 MuLV developed high plasma levels of the species-specific virion antigen p30, but during 9 months of observation failed to manifest clinical signs of leukemia. Plasma p30 levels of NIH Swiss mice (non-permissive host) that were inoculated also as neonates with the same virus preparation, remained undetectable by radioimmunoassay. Xenotropic MuLV, i.e. that which infects cells of species other than the species of origin, was released by one of the three remaining cell lines. Two of the six original lines have remained free of detectable oncornavirus production. Our results suggest that cell lines that are stable sources of large quantities of B-tropic MuLV may be easily obtainable by the described manipulations. Equally important, however, is the fact that these data re-emphasize the danger that is inherent in assuming that a cell line is virus-free simply because it was isolated from a chemical carcinogen-induced neoplasm",

Various lymphoid organs were studied including spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), lymph nodes regional to the MSV-induced tumor (RLN), and peripheral blood. Furthermore, the kinetics of appearance of cytolytic cells within the MSV-induced tumor was determined. In agreement with previous studied, it was found that cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for MSV-associated antigens were present among the cells extracted from the tumor and from the lymphoid organs. However, differences in the kinetics of CTL activity could be documented: lymphoid cells from spleen, RLN and peripheral blood showed peak activity at the time of maximum tumor diameter, while intratumoral cells showed peak activity at the onset of tumor regression. MLN cells showed cytolytic activity only when tumor regression had begun. Naturally cytotoxic cell populations of thymus-independent origin, present in normal control mice, were also detected in MSV-infected mice.",

Generation of cytotoxicity requires in vivo administration of the virus followed by in vitro culture of lymphoid cells from virus-injected animals. Lymphoid cells from MuLV-resistant C57BL/6 donors develop high levels of specific cytotoxicity after secondary in vitro stimulation with syngeneic MuLV-induced tumor cells. Cells derived from these same donors, cultured in the absence of MuLV-induced tumor cells, fail to exhibit cytotoxicity. Secondary in vitro stimulation of lymphocytes from MuLV-susceptible BALB/c animals results not only in generation of cytotoxic reactivity against syngeneic MuLV-induced tumor cells but also induces apparently autoreactive effector cells capable of lysing other H-2d tumor cells as well as normal peritoneal cells bearing H-2d antigens.

BALB/c and CBA mice, injected neonatally with Graffi or passage A Gross viruses (MuLV-Gi, MuLV-G), have been inoculated as young adults with murine sarcoma virus, Moloney strain (MSV-M). A higher percentage of nonregressing sarcomas appeared in these animals, sometimes accompanied simultaneously by leukemia. The immune reactivity of mice receiving MuLV-Gi at birth was found to be significantly depressed when evaluated by the hemolytic palque-forming cell (PFC) technique. However, in mice infected with MuLV-Gi and MSV-M the number of PFC ranged within the control values or slightly increased. The potentiation of MSV-M oncogenicity following infection with MuLV was studied in a more natural situation. Adult AKR mice, known to release endogenous MuLV continuously, were injected with MSV-M. The incidence of induced sarcomas was similar to that observed in control BALB/c mice inoculated with MSV-M. Moreover, tumors developed with a very long latent period. On the other hand, the great majority of tumors showed no regression and ultimately killed the host. Additional experiments, making use of immunologic manipulation of the host and Fl hybrids, suggest that the relative resistance to MSV-M oncogenesis in AKR mice is influenced by genetic and immunologic factors. MSV recovered from MSV-M-induced tumors in AKR and C58 mice was typed by highly specific mouse antisera. The results clearly showed that formation of a new MSV pseudotype occurred in vivo, the endogenous Gross virus acting as helper.",

The Moloney murine sarcoma virus-immune spleen cells, however, did not respond to other murine type C viruses, to AKR and Rauscher viruses, or to murine mammary tumor virus. The immune spleen cells also responded specifically to purified glycoprotein with molecular weights of 69,000 and 71,000 and proteins with molecular weights of 30,000 and 12,000, but not to protein with a molecular weight of 10,000, of the homologous M-MuLV.

Similarly, the immune spleen cells responded to membrane fractions purified from the MBL-2 cells. Comparable membrane fractions prepared from a Gross virus-induced leukemia, E male G2, and a radiation-induced leukemia, RL male 1, were not active. The tumor-associated surface antigens of MBL-2 membranes could be solubilized by the detergent, Nonident P-40.

Two cell lines free of endogenous type C virus were examined and found to be highly tumorigenic in tumor growth kinetic studies. In vitro inoculation of these cell lines with Rauscher-murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV) resulted in their chronic infection in which 95 to 100% of the cells were scored as virus positive. These infected lines showed a highly significant increase in their immunogenicity as compared to their uninfected controls. Animals in which these virus-positive tumors regressed were then shown to be highly resistant to challenge with the uninfected tumor cell lines as well as to live R-MuLV. This observed resistance to uninfected tumor cell lines could not be induced by immunization of the mouse with uninfected tumor cells and R-MuLV simultaneously at the same injection site, nor could it be induced with lethally irradiated virus-infected tumor cells, subtumorigenic doses of uninfected cells, or inactivated R-MuLV or Gross leukemia virus (G-MuLV). Cell-mediated cytotoxicity studies revealed that spleen cells obtained from animals whose virus-infected tumors regressed were cytotoxic to homologous infected and uninfected tumor cells as well as to other uninfected tumor cell lines syngeneic to the BALB/c mouse. Correlation of in vitro cytotoxicity with in vivo immunity was provided by the Winn assay, by inoculation into susceptible mice of immune and nonimmune spleen cells premixed with uninfected tumor cells. The immune cells were highly effective in preventing this tumor cell transplantation. It was concluded that type-C virus infection of these syngeneic tumor cells resulted in their acquiring strong transplantation antigens that were in part due to the virion, but were at least in part due to alterations of antigens or haptens that are present in a less immunogenic form on the uninfected tumor cell.",

Continuous administration of either chemicals resulted in the occurrence of thymic lymphoma in every mouse with a short latent period. The time of appearance and distribution pattern of MLV infectivity in various tissues were examined by the XC plaque assay technique at fixed intervals during the leukemogenic treatment. In ENU- or BNU-treated mice, only a few samples of the thymus showed MLV infectivity with rather low titers during incubation period and the presence of MLV was not consistent even in leukemic cases though the thymus was almost invariably the target of leukemogenesis. On the other hand, many samples of the uterus, spleen, and mesenteric node from non-leukemic and leukemic mice harbored a good quantity of MLV. In tissues such as the liver, kidney, bone marrow, and muscle, positive cases occurred only sporadically. Observations on the MLV infectivity in untreated controls were almost comparable with those in leukemogen-treated mice. These results indicate that the infectivity of MLV, detected by the XC plaque assay technique, is not necessarily related to the induction of leukemia in mice by exogenous agents.",

Another 2--8 weeks after the decrease in percent T-cells occurred, the first lymphomatous foci became obvious in the thymus. Clinically overt and generalized lymphoma was diagnosed at 20--30 weeks post virus infection.

The animals were sacrified at different time intervals from the beginning of the intoxication. Histological and ultrastructural studies of peripheral nerves and long tracts of the spinal cord revealed a severe axonopathy, characterized by swelling of axons, particularly in the paranodal regions due to accumulation of neurofilaments with almost complete disappearance of neurotubules. There was also aggregation of dense bodies, swollen mitochondria and multivescicolar bodies in subaxolemmal regions. Presynaptic endings in the anterior horns of the spinal cord and in the cuneate nuclei were swollen and filled with packed filaments. Fiber degeneration at different stages was seen both in PNS and in CNS. These changes are not specific for acrylamide intoxication, having been observed in other experimentally induced neuropathies (n-hexane, Mn-BK, CS2, ...), as well as in a variety of diseases both genetically determined and due to exposure to toxic substances (glue-sniffing, leather cement poisoning, antiblastic therapy, ...). Accumulation of filaments in peripheral and central axons is the pattern of fiber degeneration characterizing the dying-back neuropathies. These axonal changes are particularly marked in the pacinian bodies as well as in the distal segments of the fibres. These data support the hypothesis that a dying-back neuropathy might depend on the direct effect of the toxic substance on the most vulnerable segments of the fibres, rather than on the perikaryon of the nerve cell, as previously supposed.",

Radioactivity decreased exponentially along the entire optic chiasm. Counts were distributed among the lipid, protein, and acid-soluble fractions. Separation of optic nerve lipids revealed appreciable labeling of most lipid classes including those characteristic of myelin; a markedly different labeling pattern was observed for axonally transported lipids.

On the other hand, segmental demyelination occurred approximately as frequently in proximal as in distal parts of nerves. At 3 months approximately 1/3 of teased myelinated fibers showed changes of segmental demyelination (Condition C), or of remyelination after segmental demyelination (Condition F) or of both segmental demyelination and of remyelination (Condition D), while at 6 months more than 4/5ths of fibers showed these changes. As expected, regression lines of axonal area on number of lamellae of myelin, were less steep in nerves of rats fed on lead for 6 months as compared to controls. Axonal transport of choline acetyltransferase in lead neuropathy did not differ from that in control rats. As expected from the studies of others, conduction velocity of myelinated fibers of caudal nerve were low. A new finding was the often quite striking increase of transverse fascicular area of peripheral nerves. This was due to edema which appeared to develop at about the time of onset os segmental demyelination.

    "input": "The projections of serotonin-containing neurons of the midbrain raphe nuclei (nucleus raphe dorsalis, nucleus centralis superior) are studied by analysis of axonal transport of labeled amino acids. These results are correlated with regional alterations of serotonin content following midbrain raphe lesions which produce significant serotonin depletion in nearly all regions of the central nervous system. Twenty-four hours following injection of 100 muCi [3H]proline, raphe neurons have taken up labeled material and transported it, presumably as protein, to telencephalon, diencephalon, brain stem, the cerebellum and the spinal cord. This transport appears to take place predominantly in serotonin neurons. After injection of 100 muCi [3H]5-HTP into nucleus raphe dorsalis or nucleus centralis superior, the pattern of regional distribution of transported material is very similar to that obtained with tritiated proline. Selective lesions of serotonin terminals with 5.6-DHT result in greatly diminished axonal transport of proteins to all telencephalic, diencephalic and mesencephalic areas as well as to cerebellum, pons-medulla and spinal cord. Unilateral destruction of the medial forebrain bundle results in significant reduction in axonal transport of labeled material to ipsilateral telencehalon and thalamus. These results provide further support for the view that serotonin neurons of the midbrain raphe nuclei project widely throughout the neuraxis to telencephalon, diencephalon, brain stem, cerebellum and spinal cord.",

    "input": "Two main classes of morphological change follow trauma to central nerve fibres: (1) axonal disruption leads to total disintegration of the fibre distal (with respect to the cell body) to the lesion; (2) less severe trauma produces focal demyelination with preservation of axonal continuity. Large experimental demyelinating lesions produce complete conduction block. The histologically normal portions of the fibres, proximal and distal to the lesion, retain the ability to transmit impulses. Smaller lesions allow conduction to continue, but at a reduced velocity, and the ability of the fibres to carry long trains of impulses faithfully is impaired. All three defects of conduction contribute to functional loss. After acute transient compression of the spinal cord of the cat, demyelination increases during the first week. Evidence of remyelination appears in the third week. Inappropriately thin myelin is seen surrounding histologically normal axons. By one month, 90% of the fibres in the lesion have acquired new sheaths. Studies on single fibres have shown that the myelin is organized into segments bounded by nodes. The segments are abnormally thin and short. The myelin increases in thickness with time but thin segments are still present at 18 months. Electron microscopy shows that many of the known ultrastructural prerequisites for conduction are present in the new segments. It is not yet known, however, whether the chains of very short internodes which occur on some fibres allow conduction to be restored.",

The superior cervical ganglion represents an exception; large numbers of fluorescent fibres but few fluorescent ganglion cells were apparent during recovery. Axon counts carried out by electron microscopy on the vas deferens showed that after recovery for one year the number of axons was similar to that of controls; however, the pattern of innervation was abnormal, small granular vesicles were rarely seen and there was little uptake of 5-hydroxydopamine.

    "input": "Electrophysiological, biochemical, and morphometric observations were made on the peripheral nerves of rats after galactose feeding. Motor nerve conduction velocity was found to be reduced. This was associated with an accumulation of galactitol in the peripheral nerves and a diminution in their myoinositol content. An increased water content and fascicular area, taken in conjunction with a probable increase in the area of the endoneurial spaces, indicated overhydration of the peripheral nerves. Morphometric observations on the myelinated fibre population in the tibial nerve showed no loss of fibres and although both the maximal and the average diameter of the myelinated fibres was slightly less than in age-matched controls, this was insufficient to explain the reduction in conduction velocity. Segmental demyelination was not detected and the relationship between myelin thickness and axon circumference was not altered. Electron microscope observations revealed no ultrastructural changes in the myelinated fibres and, in particular, no abnormalities at the nodes of Ranvier or indication of abnormal hydration of the Schwann cells. The relevance of these findings to the peripheral nerve changes in human and experimental diabetes is discussed.",

    "instruction": "What isotope labeling resulted in especially prominent glial cell labeling in the normal optic nerve head?",
    "input": "A systematic study of axoplasmic transport in the normal optic nerve head is essential to the understanding of the role of this process in the pathogenesis of disease of the optic nerve. Twenty-one eyes from normal adult rhesus monkeys were subjected to intravitreal injections of tritiated leucine (3H) or proline (3H). Light microscopic autoradiographs were prepared on these eyes and optic nerves six hours to 60 days after injection. The isotope that was incorporated in cytoplasmic components associated with the slow phase of axoplasmic transport (3H leucine) became concentrated in the temporal region of the optic nerve head, unevenly distributed within axons in the axonal bundles, and apparently accumulated in axons or glial cells, or both, in the lamina choroidalis and scleralis as a broad pulse of isotope moved across the optic nerve head. Several anatomic factors, including the distribution of macular fibers, increasing amounts of glial cells within the same axonal bundles as the optic nerve passed from the lamina retinalis to the lamina scleralis, and the abrupt addition of myelin sheaths to axons behind the lamina scleralis, contributed to the complex distribution of isotope in the normal optic nerve head. Glial cell labeling was especially prominent with 3H proline.",

As controls, pieces were immersed for an identical period in the same buffers (1) without HMM or (2) with HMM to which had been added 2.5 mM Na+ pyrophosphate or 5 mM ATP. In control neurons smooth-surfaced microfilaments, about 50 A in diameter, were observed. After reaction with HMM, the microfilaments were increased in number and density and in width to 180-200 A. A meshwork was formed. Arrowheads pointing in the same direction were spaced at regular intervals (300-350 A) among short segments of the surfaces of the microfilaments, depending upon the plane of section. More often, however, typical arrowheads were not observed, and the surfaces of the microfilaments were seen coated with polarized side-arms cross-bridging the spaces between adjacent elements at more or less regular intervals. When cross-sectioned, the microfilaments appeared as dense dots from which a material of lesser electron density radiated. Following incubation in HMM solutions containing Na+ pyrophosphate or ATP, no arrowhead structures were seen. Of particular interest was the structural relation of the actin-like filaments with occasional, tapered myosin-like filaments, and with the plasma membrane, which served as anchor points. Mitochondria and smooth ER membranes were observed to be attached to the actin-like filaments or enmeshed in the network. The microtubules, as well as most of the neurofilaments, were disrupted by the glycerination procedure at 4 degrees, and thus no precision about the structural relationship of the actin-like filaments with the latter elements could be added. The role of the actin-like filaments in the transport of material, by a mechanism of chemomechanical transduction, throughout the neuron from sites of synthesis to functional locations, and between several functional locations, is discussed.",

    "input": "It could be shown that extracts of growing cultures of Acanthamoeba castellanii contained a cellulose degrading system. Reducing sugars are split off by one component of this system at an optimum of pH 4, another enzyme changes the viscosity at an optimum of pH 6, and a third component is a beta-glucosidase with an optimum at pH 3.5. At pH 4 the cellulose degradation products are cellobiose and glucose; at pH 6 higher molecular weight oligosaccharides are produced. During the development from trophozoites to cysts in a nutrient-free medium, the activities of both cellulases decline: Prior to the start of cellulose synthesis only 30%, and in cysts only 10% of the original existing activities are detectable. The biological function of the cellulase enzyme system is discussed together with a consideration of the fact that excystment takes place without digestion of the cyst wall in which the cellulose is deposited.",

    "instruction": "What happened to the specific activity of superoxide dismutase when the availability of glucose was abruptly increased?",
    "input": "Conditions for continuous culture of Escherichia coli K-12 His- Thi- under glucose limitation were established. Both the capacity for respiration, at D greater than 0.2/h, and specific activity of superoxide dismutase increased as a function of specific growth rate, whereas peroxidase and catalase were either invariant with or inversely related to this growth rate. The abrupt increase in the availability of glucose, as a means of elevating the growth rate, was followed by an increase in superoxide dismutase, which reached a plateau before there was a significant increase in the growth rate. Thus, an increase in superoxide dismutase appeared to be a prerequisite for an increase in the rate of growth. Cells that had higher levels of superoxide dismutase, because of varying specific growth rates, were more resistant to the toxicity of hyperbaric oxygen. Superoxide dismutase thus behaved like an essential defense against the toxicity of oxygen. Sensitivity towards streptonigrin increased with specific growth rate in the range of 0.09 to 0.25/h but decreased with further increases in the growth rate. Since this antibiotic has been shown to shunt electrons to oxygen, with concomitant production of O2-, these results indicated a progressive deficiency of reducing power at growth rates below 0.25/h and a surfeit of reducing power with progressively greater protection against O2- by superoxide dismutase at growth rates greater than 0.25/h.",
    "output": "In the context provided, when the availability of glucose was abruptly increased, the specific activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased first, reaching a plateau before there was a significant increase in the growth rate. This suggests that an increase in SOD is a prerequisite for an increase in the rate of growth. The higher levels of SOD in cells also made them more resistant to the toxicity of hyperbaric oxygen, indicating that SOD behaves like an essential defense against the toxicity of oxygen. It's also noted that there's a surfeit of reducing power with progressively greater protection against O2- by superoxide dismutase at growth rates greater than 0.25/h. This implies that SOD plays a crucial role in managing reactive oxygen species (like superoxide anion O2-) that can be toxic to the cells, especially under conditions of increased growth rate and oxygen availability."

    "input": "The obligate aerobic yeast, Rhodotorula gracilis, was grown in a liquid minimal medium at 1 mm Hg partial pressure of oxygen, conditions under which growth (measured as the increase in total protein) is reduced to 30% of the maximum rate. A significant increase in the ratio between mitochondrial oxidative enzymes and total protein occurs rapidly under these conditions. A concurrent increase in the ratio area of mitochondria/area of cytoplasm was also observed. The relative increase in mitochondrial enzymes, oxidase activities and mitochondrial membranes is due to the inhibition affecting the increase in cytoplasmic structures more significantly than the increase in mitochondrial structures at low pO2. The difference between mitochondrial and cytoplasmic syntheses cannot be ascribed to changes in the availability of ATP but it might rest with some other oxygen-utilising process (pyrimidine redox coenzymes, synthesis of sterols). The experimental conditions studied appear to offer a valuable tool for the investigation of the relationships between mitochondrial and cytoplasmic structures.",

    "instruction": "What was the effect of sulphate limitation on the growth yields of Escherichia coli K12 with respect to glycerol consumption?",
    "input": "Growth of Escherichia coli K12 in a chemostat was limited by sulphate concentrations lower than 300 muM. The synthesis of extracellular polysaccharide and a change in morphology accompanied sulphate-limited growth. Growth yields with respect to the amount of glycerol or oxygen consumed were sixfold and twofold lower respectively under these conditions than when growth was limited by glycerol. Sulphate-limited cells lacked the proton-translocating oxidoreduction segment of the electron-transport chain between NADH and the cytochromes, and particles prepared from these cells lacked the energy-dependent reduction of NAD+ by succinate, DL-alpha-glycerophosphate or D-lactate, suggesting the loss of site-I phosphorylation. Glycerol-limited cells contained cytochrome b556, b562 and o, ubiquinone and low concentrations of menaquinone. Sulphate limitation resulted in the additional synthesis of cytochromes d, a1, b558 and c550; the amount of ubiquinone was decreased and menaquinone was barely detectable. Non-haem iron and acid-labile sulphide concentrations were twofold lower in electron-transport particles prepared from sulphate-limited cells. Recovery of site-I phosphorylation could not be demonstrated after incubating sulphate-limited cells with or without glycerol, in either the absence or presence of added sulphate. The loss of site-I phosphorylation in sulphate-limited cells is discussed with reference to the accompanying alterations in cytochrome composition of such cells. Schemes are proposed for the functional organization of the respiratory chains of E. coli grown under conditions of glycerol or sulphate limitation.",
    "output": "Under sulphate limitation, the growth yields of Escherichia coli K12 with respect to glycerol consumption were sixfold lower compared to when growth was limited by glycerol. This suggests that the cells struggle to consume glycerol efficiently under sulphate-limited conditions. Additionally, the synthesis of certain cytochromes (d, a1, b558, and c550) was increased, while the amount of ubiquinone was decreased and menaquinone was barely detectable. These changes in cytochrome composition could be contributing to the observed reduction in glycerol consumption. However, the exact mechanism behind this effect requires further investigation."

In contrast to fructose-biphosphatase, phosoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase, which are inactivated after the addition of glucose to derepressed cells, the proteinases and inhibitors are not inactivated after glucose addition, but appear to be repressed. Growth of the yeast on poor nitrogen sources or starvation for nitrogen results in 2-3 fold increases in the levels of most proteinases and peptidases, but this effect is not observed with glucose as the carbon source.",

From the context provided, we can see that the activities of these two aminopeptidases in glucose-grown cells were 30-50% of those in acetate-grown cells.

    "instruction": "What was the only low-molecular-weight product released when the partially purified enzyme preparation degraded amylose and glycogen?",
    "input": "During meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the polysaccharide glycogen is first synthesized and then degraded during the period of spore maturation. We have detected, in sporulating yeast strains, an enzyme activity which is responsible for the glycogen catabolism. The activity was absent in vegetative cells, appeared coincidently with the beginning of glycogenolysis and the appearance of mature ascospores, and increased progressively until spourlation was complete. The specific activity of glycogenolytic enzymes in the intact ascus was about threefold higher than in isolated spores. The glycogenolysis was not due to combinations of phosphorylase plus phosphatase or amylase plus maltase. Nonsporulating cells exhibited litle or no glycogen catabolism and contained only traces of glycogenolytic enzyme, suggesting that the activity is sporulation specific. The partially purified enzyme preparation degraded amylose and glycogen, releasing glucose as the only low-molecular-weight product. Maltotriose was rapidly hydrolyzed; maltose was less susceptible. Alpha-methyl-D-glucoside, isomaltose, and linear alpha-1,6-linked dextran were not attacked. However, the enzyme hydrolyzed alpha-1,6-glucosyl-Schardinger dextrin and increased the beta-amylolysis of beta-amylase-limit dextrin. Thus, the preparation contains alpha-1,4- and alpha-1,6-glucosidase activities. Sephadex G-150 chromatography partially resolved the enzyme into two activities, one of which may be a glucamylase and the other a debranching enzyme.",

    "input": "Effects of the carbon source and oxygen on ethylene production by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been studied. The amounts of ethylene evolved by the yeast culture were less than those detected in the blank (an equal volume of uninoculated medium), suggesting a net absorption of ethylene by the yeast cells. Addition of glucose to the lactate-grown yeast culture induced ethylene production. This glucose-induced stimulation of ethylene production was inhibited to a great extent by cycloheximide. Results suggested that the yeast cells in the presence of glucose synthesized an ethylene precursor and passed it into the medium. The conversion of this precursor to ethylene might be stimulated by oxygen. The fact that ethylene was produced by the yeast growing anaerobically and also by respiration-deficient mutants isolated from the wild-type yeast suggested that mitochondrial ATP synthesis was not an absolute requirement for ethylene biogenesis.",
    "output": "The addition of cycloheximide significantly inhibited the glucose-induced stimulation of ethylene production in the yeast culture. This indicates that the synthesis of an ethylene precursor in the yeast cells might be dependent on protein synthesis, as cycloheximide is an inhibitor of protein synthesis in fungi. The conversion of this precursor to ethylene might still be stimulated by oxygen, but its production seems to be regulated by protein synthesis in the presence of glucose."

    "input": "A direct correlation between the absorbance of a thermophilic bacillus and specific amidase activity was observed, which was found to depend on the cell density of the culture rather than on the time of contact of the culture with the inducer. Dilution of high density cultures caused the specific amidase activity to decrease. Environmental factors such as pH, concentration of inducer or degree of aeration, and level of NH+4 and glutamate had no effect on amidase synthesis. The decrease in amidase activity upon dilution could not be ascribed to destruction by oxygen or by inactivation or decay. Several lines of evidence suggest that catabolite repression is responsible for the phenomenon described. Succinate-grown cultures gave a stronger dilution effect thatn glutamate-grown cells. The mutant strain E-21, relatively resistant to catabolite repression, did not show the characteristic dilution effect nor the direct correlation between absorbance and specific amidase activity.",
    "output": "The specific amidase activity decreased when high density cultures of the thermophilic bacillus were diluted. This decrease is likely due to catabolite repression, a phenomenon where the synthesis of enzymes involved in the metabolism of certain substrates is inhibited by the presence of other readily available carbon sources, in this case, succinate or glutamate. The mutant strain E-21, relatively resistant to catabolite repression, did not show the characteristic dilution effect nor the direct correlation between absorbance and specific amidase activity, further supporting this hypothesis."

    "input": "During the log-phase growth of Proteus mirabilis the specific activity of catalase decreases, while at the beginning of or during the stationary phase an increase takes place which is abolished by inhibitors of nucleic acid or protein synthesis. Glucose in the culture medium has no appreciable effect on the level of enzyme synthesis nor does the passage of bacteria to anaerobiosis bring any noticeable change. Successive additions of hydrogen peroxide up to weak final concentrations (0.2--0.5 mM) stimulate catalase synthesis. Determination of the enzyme in vivo reveals but a weak proportion of the total catalase which can only be titrated after the breakdown of cells. The titrable enzyme in vivo represents, as an order of magnitude, the activity found associated with the cell wall, in an easily released form after the mechanical separation of the inner and outer membranes. Thus, bacteria can act upon exogenous peroxide only through a peripheral catalase while they possess in a masked form an important reserve of cytoplasmic enzyme.",
    "output": "During the log-phase growth of Proteus mirabilis, the specific activity of catalase decreases. This decrease is not affected by the presence of glucose in the culture medium or by the transition to anaerobiosis. However, successive additions of hydrogen peroxide stimulate catalase synthesis. In vivo, only a weak proportion of the total catalase is active, with the majority being in a masked form within the cytoplasm. The active, peripheral catalase is associated with the cell wall, and the bacteria can only act upon exogenous peroxide through this peripheral catalase. The reserve of cytoplasmic enzyme remains masked until the cells are broken down."

    "input": "Dialysis culture was used to investigate the extent to which growth inhibition in bacterial cultures may be caused by accumulation of metabolites. Escherichia coli B was grown in a glucose/salts medium. A concentrated nutrient solution was pumped at a constant rate into the growing culture to ensure that growth was not limited by exhaustion of nutrients. In this way the only difference between growth conditions in dialysis and non-dialysis cultures was the transfer of dialysable metabolites from the culture vessel to the reservoir in the dialysis culture system. By adjusting the glucose concentration in the feed and maintaining a constant rate of feeding, glucose-limited growth could be achieved. Under these conditions, with oxygen in excess, bacterial yields of 140 to 150 g dry wt l-1 were obtained in dialysis culture compared with 30 to 40 g l-1 in non-dialysis culture. The high yields in dialysis culture depended on the removal of end-products of glucose metabolism. Growth inhibition was demonstrated to be the result of the combined influence of acetate, lactate, pyruvate, succinate, propionate and isobutyrate in concentrations found at the end of growth in non-dialysis cultures of Escherichia coli B.",

In fact, the presence of such serological markers is virtually required for the diagnosis of active disease. This report describes 5 well-studied patients with SLE who initially presented with negative serology despite active multisystemic disease. When followed from 10 months to 7 yr, negative serologic markers, including the ANA, LE cell test, and anti-DNA were seen to change from negative to positive, analogous to the seronegative rheumatoid patient who may become seropositive. In a few cases of lupus, therefore, negative serologic tests do not always exclude SLE, and serial testing at periodic intervals may be indicated.",

By monitoring the intensities of two hyperfine shifted proton resonances (at about -12 and -18 ppm from H(2)O) and two exchangeable proton resonances (at about -6.4 and -9.4 ppm from H(2)O) as a function of oxygenation, the amount of oxygen bound to the alpha and beta chains of a hemoglobin molecule can be determined and the relationship between tertiary and quaternary structural changes under a given set of experimental conditions can be investigated. These results suggest that: (i) in the absence of organic phosphates, there is no preferential O(2) binding to the alpha or beta chains; (ii) in the presence of organic phosphates, the alpha hemes have a higher affinity for O(2) as compared to the beta hemes; (iii) the ligand-induced structural changes in the hemoglobin molecule are not concerted; and (iv) some cooperativity must be present within the deoxy quaternary state during the oxygenation process. The variations of the exchangeable proton resonances as a function of oxygenation strongly suggest that the breaking of one or more inter- or intrasubunit linkages of a ligated subunit can affect similar linkages in unligated subunits within a tetrameric hemoglobin molecule. Thus, the present results show that two-state allosteric models are not adequate to describe the cooperative oxygenation of hemoglobin.

As the changes of oxygen affinity of Hb A induced by changes of pH are due to the modifications of R state, this quaternary conformation is thought to be unchanged in the studied of R state, this quaternary conformation is thought to be unchanged in the studied forms of partially oxidized hemoglobin. It is suggested that interactions between ferric and ferrous hemes leading to the increased affinity of ferrous hemes to oxygen occur in deoxygenated form of partially oxidized hemoglobin. In partially oxidized hemoglobin with ferric hemes liganded with H2O asymmetry of oxygen binding curves has been noted, which is not observed in forms with ferric hemes liganded with OH ot CN. This shows the effect of ligands of ferric hemes on interactions between chains containing ferric and ferrous hemes.",

    "input": "This paper reports the properties of human hemoglobin covalently bound to Sepharose 4B both in 'high-affinity' and 'low-affinity' conformations. The results suggest that the coupling reaction is strongly affected by the conformational changes linked to oxygenation of the protein. The rate and the extent of the reaction are different for the oxy and deoxyderivatives, probably due to the change in reactivity of the amino groups in the liganded and unliganded tetramer. The data on the equilibrium which is established between matrix-bound and soluble subunits, measured by the 'subunit-exchange chromatography', indicate that the system displays a minimal heterogeneity when hemoglobin is coupled to the gel in the deoxy state at intermediate protein concentration and pH 8. Maxtrix-bound hemoglobin is characterized by a higher oxygen affinity and by decreased homotropic and heterotropic interactions with respect to hemoglobin in solution, but the changes depend strongly on the conditions used in the coupling procedure.",

The sigmoid coefficient at pH 6 is 0.7; at pH 8.7 n was determined to be 1.3. As the reason of these altered binding properties a blockade of the primary amino groups, disturbance of the salt bridges, and restrained cooperative mobility of the Hb-subunits are discussed. The Hill coefficient is additionally lowered by the heterogeneity of the immobilized Hb.",
    "output": "The sigmoid coefficient (n) at pH 8.7 for hemoglobin covalently fixed to CM-Sephadex is 1.3. This indicates a stronger sigmoid shape for the oxygen binding curve at this pH compared to pH 6, where the sigmoid coefficient was 0.7. This change is likely due to the blockade of primary amino groups, disturbance of salt bridges, and restrained cooperative mobility of the Hb-subunits in the alkaline pH region."

The modified protein shows increased oxygen affinity with complete abolition of the effect of K-glycerate 2, 3-bisphosphate. The Bohr effect is abolished in the acid range and drastically reduced at alkaline pH values. Changes in the kinetics of ligand reactions parallel the oxygen equilibrium results. Cooperative effects are still present. Human erythrocytes treated with 2-methoxy-5-nitrotropone show increased oxygen affinity and some decrease in methemoglobin reductase efficiency but no change in resistance to hemolysis.",
    "output": "The effect of 2-methoxy-5-nitrotropone on the Bohr effect of human hemoglobin at alkaline pH values is a drastic reduction. At pH 7.4, the modification of the four N-terminal amino groups of human hemoglobin due to its reaction with 2-methoxy-5-nitrotropone results in an increased oxygen affinity, complete abolition of the effect of K-glycerate 2, 3-bisphosphate, and a reduction in the Bohr effect in the acid range. However, at alkaline pH values, the Bohr effect is significantly reduced. This reduction in the Bohr effect suggests that the binding of hydrogen ions to the deoxygenated hemoglobin, which is a key mechanism in the Bohr effect, is affected by the modification with 2-methoxy-5-nitrotropone. Despite this reduction in the Bohr effect, cooperative effects are still present in the modified hemoglobin. Additionally, human erythrocytes treated with 2-methoxy-5-nitrotropone show increased oxygen affinity and some decrease in methemoglobin reductase efficiency but no change in resistance to hemolysis."

The oxygen equilibrium curves of the two hemoglobins and the effects of organic phosphates on the function were investigated. In 0.1 M phosphate buffer, Hill's constants n for Hb Yakima and Hb Kempsey were 1.0 to 1.1 at the pH range for 6.5 to 8.0 and the oxygen affinities of both the mutant hemoglobins were about 15 to 20 times that of Hb A at pH 7.0. The Bohr effect was normal in Hb Yakima and one-fourth normal in Hb Kempsey. In the presence of inositol hexaphosphate, the oxygen affinities to Hb Yakima and Hb Kempsey were greatly decreased, and an interesting result revealed that these hemoglobins showed clear cooperativity in oxygen binding. Hill's constant n in the presence of inositol hexaphosphate was 1.9 for Hb Kempsey and 2.3 for Hb Yakima at pH 7.0. The cooperativities of these mutant hemoglobins were pH-dependent, and Hb Kempsey showed high cooperativity at low pH (n equal 2.1 at pH 6.6) and low cooperativity at high pH (n equal 1.0 at pH 8.0). Hb Yakima showed similar pH dependence in cooperativity. In the presence of inositol hexaphosphate, Hb A showed a pH-dependent cooperativity different from those of Hb Yakima and Hb Kempsey, namely, Hill's n was the highest in alkaline pH (n equal 3.0 at pH 8.0) and decreased at lower pH (n equal 1.5 at pH 6.5). 2,3Diphosphoglycerate bound with the deoxygenated Hb Yakima and Hb Kempsey, however, had no effect on the oxygen binding of these abnormal hemoglobin. The pH-dependent cooperativity of alpha1beta2 contact anomalous hemoglobin and normal hemoglobin was explained by the shifts in the equilibrium between the high and low ligand affinity forms.",

The substitution affects one of the 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate binding sites, resulting in an increased affinity for oxygen, but both the haem-haem interaction and the alkaline Bohr effect are normal in the haemolysate. This variant had the same mobility as haemoglobin A on electrophoresis at alkaline pH but was detected by measuring the whole blood oxygen affinity; it could be separated from haemoglobin A, however, by electrophoresis in agar at acid pH. The raised haemoglobin concentration was mainly due to a reduction in plasma volume (a relative polycythaemia) and was associated with a persistently raised white blood count. This case emphasises the need to measure the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin in all patients with absolute or relative polycythaemia when some obvious cause is not evident.",
    "output": "The main reason for the raised haemoglobin concentration in the patient with the Hb Rahere variant is a relative polycythaemia, which is a condition where there is an excess of red blood cells in the blood relative to the plasma volume. This is due to the increased oxygen affinity of the Hb Rahere variant, which leads to more efficient oxygen transport and reduced need for red blood cells in the bloodstream. Additionally, the patient in this case also had a persistently raised white blood count, which could contribute to the relative polycythaemia."

As [HbCO] varied through the range of 2, 25, 50, and 75%, P50 was 26.3, 18.0, 11.6, and 6.5 mmHg, respectively. CO2 Bohr effect was highest at low oxygen saturations. This effect did not change as [HbCO] was increased. However, as [HbCO] was increased from 2 to 75%, the fixed acid Bohr factor increased in magnitude from -0.20 to -0.80 at very low oxygen saturations. The effect of molecular CO2 binding (carbamino) on oxygen affinity was eliminated at high [HbCO]. These results are consistent with the initial binding of O2 or CO to the alpha-chain of hemoglobin. The results also suggest that heme-heme interaction is different for oxygen than for carbon monoxide.",

Provided they are refered to intra-erythrocytic pH, none of these values were changed when varying environment.

    "input": "The pH dependence of several functional properties of human fetal and adult hemoglobins have been studied to determine the relative stabilities of the high and low affinity (R and T) quaternary conformations of the two proteins under different conditions. Fetal aqumethemoglobin undergoes changes in sulfhydryl reactivity, absorption spectrum, and circular dichroism in the presence of insitol hexaphospahte which are consistent with a transition from the R to T quaternary state, but only at pH values below 6.8. In adult hemoglobin this transition can be induced pH values below 7.2. Even in the absence of phosphates, the ultraviolet (uv) circular dichroism spectrum of fetal aquomethemoglobin at low pH indicates the presence of some T conformation. The initial value for the second-order rate constant for combination of fetal deoxyhemoglobin with carbon monoxide is comparable to that for adult hemoglobin in the absence of organic phosphates and is not reduced by organic phosphates as much as that for the adult protein. The apparent first-order rate constant for dissociation of CO from fully liganded fetal hemoglobin, measured by replacement with NO, increases threefold in the absence of organic phosphates, and fourfold in the presence of organic phosphates, with decreasing pH; the midpoint of the pH dependent transition occurs around 6.8. A similar increase in the apparent first-order rate constant for O2 dissociation as measured by replacement with CO, can also be seen with decreasing pH. NO-hemoglobin F can be converted to the T state even when fully liganded simply by lowering the pH, as judged by uv circular dichroism, visible difference spectrum in the region of the alpha and beta bands, and a dramatic increase in the rate of NO dissociation, measured by replacement with CO in the presence of dithionite. These results are all consistent with a model for fetal hemoglobin in which the organic phosphate site may be functionally weakened by replacement of a residue involved in ionic interactions with the negatively charged phosphate groups, but in which the low affinity T conformation is intrinsically more stable than that of adllt hemoglobin. According to this model,the differences between fetal and adult hemoglobin can be accounted for primarily in terms of the relative stabilities of R and T conformations in each of the proteins with differences in the intrinsic properties of the individual conformations contributing effects of only secondary importance.",

The lipid composition of all the plasma membranes was remarkably similar, except for the concentration of free fatty acids and glycerides. The latter two were particularily high in the mouse lymphoma membrane and these, rather than a low cholesterol concentration, were responsible for the increased fluidity of the cells. The most prominent protein in most of the plasma membrane preparations was actin. This is found only by some authors, and its presence probably depends on the method of lymphocyte disruption.",

    "input": "The lipid distribution in binary mixed membranes containing charged and uncharged lipids and the effect of Ca2+ and polylysine on the lipid organization was studied by the spin label technique. Dipalmitoyl phosphatidic acid was the charged, and spin labelled dipalmitoyl lecithin was the uncharged (zwitterionic) component. The ESR spectra were analyzed in terms of the spin exchange frequency, Wex. By measuring Wex as a function of the molar percentage of labelled lecithin a distinction between a random and a heterogeneous lipid distribution could be made. It is established that mixed lecithin-phosphatidic acid membranes exhibit lipid segregation (or a miscibility gap) in the fluid state. Comparative experiments with bilayer and monolayer membranes strongly suggest a lateral lipid segregation. At low lecithin concentration, aggregates containing between 25% and 40% lecithin are formed in the fluid phosphatidic acid membrane. This phase separation in membranes containing charged lipids is understandable on the basis of the Gouy-Chapman theory of electric double layers. In dipalmitoyl lecithin and in dimyristoyl phosphatidylethanolamine membranes the labelled lecithin is randomly distributed above the phase transition and has a coefficient of lateral diffusion of D = 2.8-10(-8) cm2/s at 59 degrees C. Addition of Ca2+ dramatically increases the extent of phase separation in lecithin-phosphatidic acid membranes. This chemically (and isothermally) induced phase separation is caused by the formation of crystalline patches of the Ca2+-bound phosphatidic acid. Lecithin is squeezed out from these patches of rigid lipid. The observed dependence of Wex on the Ca2+ concentration could be interpreted quantitatively on the basis of a two-cluster model. At low lecithin and Ca2+ concentration clusters containing about 30 mol % lecithin are formed. At high lecithin or Ca2+ concentrations a second type of precipitation containing 100% lecithin starts to form in addition. A one-to-one binding of divalent ions and phosphatidic acid at pH 9 was assumed. Such a one-to-one binding at pH 9 was established for the case of Mn2+ using ESR spectroscopy. Polylysine leads to the same strong increase in the lecithin segregation as Ca2+. The transition of the phosphatidic acid bound by the polypeptide is shifted from Tt = 47.5 degrees to Tt = 62 degrees C. This finding suggests the possibility of cooperative conformational changes in the lipid matrix and in the surface proteins in biological membranes.",

The presence of cholesterol produced an increase in the electrical resistance of black lipid membranes and a small decrease in the permeability of membranes to drugs. The permeability coefficient of salicylamide, an uncharged drug, was much larger than the coefficients of the charged drugs examined. The values for salicylic acid and p-aminobenzoic acid were much larger than comparable values predicted from their partition coefficients. Intestinal lipid membranes were more permeable to acidic drugs than phosphatidylcholine membranes. It is suggested that phospholipids and other lipid components of the small intestine may play an important role in the membrane permeability to acidic drugs. This method may be of interest in studying the complex processes of drug absorption from intestine.",

The effect of lipophilin on the organization of the lipid was studied by use of spin label probes. Two distinct components were present in the spectrum of fatty acid spin labels in the lipid-protein vesicles. One was immobilized presumably due to the presence of boundary lipid around the protein and the second component waicles and probably due to a lamellar phase but with a slightly greater order parameter. Lipophilin was found to increase the order parameter linearly with increasing concentration of protein incorporated into the vesicles.

Temperature-induced changes of these liposomes, detected by the spin-labelled phospholipids, were found to be in agreement with the previously described transitions of hydrocarbon chains of host lecithins detected by different probes and different techniques, establishing that spin-labelled phosopholipids are sensitive probes for the detection of temperature-induced changes in lecithin model membranes. In addition to the detection of already-known transitions in lecithin liposomes, the coexistence of two distinctly different enviroments was observed above the characteristic transition temperature. This phenomenon was tentatively attributed to the influence of the lecithin polar group on the fluidity of fatty acyl chains near the polar group. Combined with other results from the literature, the coexistence of two environments could be associated with the coexistence of two conformational isomers of lecithin, differing in the orientation of the polar head group with respect to the plane of bilayer. These findings have been discussed in view of the present state of knowledge regarding temperature-induced changes in model membranes.",

    "input": "A variety of proteins have been studied for their ability to interact and alter the thermotropic properties of phospholipid bilayer membranes as detected by differential scanning calorimeter. The proteins studied included: basic myelin protein (A1 protein), cytochrome c, major apoprotein of myelin proteolipid (N-2 apoprotein), gramicidin A, polylysine, ribonuclease and hemoglobin. The lipids used for the interactions were dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol. The interactions were grouped in three catagories each having very different effects on the phospholipid phase transition from solid to liquid crystalline. The calorimetric studies were also correlated with data from vesicle permeability and monolayer expansion. Ribonuclease and polylysine which exemplify group 1 interactions, show strong dependence on electrostatic binding. Their effects on lipid bilayers include an increase in the enthalpy of transition (deltaH) accompanied by either an increase or no change in the temperature of transition (Tc). In addition, they show minimal effects on vesicle permeability and monolayer expansion. It was concluded that these interactions represent simple surface binding of the protein on the lipid bilayer without penetration into the hydrocarbon region. Cytochrome c and A1 protein, which exemplify group 2 interactions, also show a strong dependence on the presence of net negative charges on the lipid bilayers for their binding. In contrast to the first group, however, they induce a drastic decrease in both Tc and deltaH of the lipid phase transition. Furthermore, they induce a large increase in the permeability of vesicles and a substantial expansion in area of closely packed monolayers at the air-water interface. It was concluded that group 2 interactions represent surface binding followed by partial penetration and/or deformation of the bilayer. Group 3 interactions, shown by proteolipid apoprotein and gramicidin A, were primarily non-polar in character, not requiring electrostatic charges and not inhibited by salt and pH changes. They had no appreciable effect on the Tc but did induce a linear decrease in the magnitude of the deltaH, proportional to the percentage of protein by weight. Membranes containing 50% proteolipid protein still exhibited a thermotropic transition with a deltaH one half that of the pure lipid, and only a small diminution of the size of the cooperative unit. It was concluded that in this case the protein was embedded within the bilayer, associating with a limited number of molecules via non-polar interactions, while the rest of the bilayer was largely unperturbed.",

    "input": "The interaction between a positively charged peptide (poly-L-lysine) and model membranes containing charged lipids has been investigated. Conformational changes of the polypeptide as well as changes in the membrane lipid distribution were observed upon lipid-protein agglutination: 1. The strong binding of polylysine is shown directly by the use of spinlabelled polypeptide. Upon binding to phosphatidic acid a shift in the hyperfine coupling constant from 16.5 to 14.6 Oe is observed. The spectrum of the lipid-bound peptide is superimposed on the spectrum of polylysine in solution. Half of the lysine groups are bound to the charged membranes. A change in the conformation of polylysine from a random coil to a partially ordered configuration is suggested. 2. Spin labelling of the lipid component gives evidence concerning the molecular organization of a lipid mixture containing charged phosphatitid acid. Addition of polylysine induces the formation of crystalline patches of bound phosphatidic acid. 3. Excimer forming pyrene decanoic acid has been employed. Addition of positively charged polylysine (pH 9.0) to phosphatidic acid membranes increases the transition temperature of the lipid from Tt = 50 to Tt = 62 degrees C. Thus, a lipid segregation of lipid into regions of phosphatidic acid bound to the peptide which differ in their microviscosity from the surrounding membrane is induced. One lysine group binds one phosphatidic acid molecule, but only half of the phosphatidic acid is bound. 4. Direct evidence for charge induced domain formation in lipid mixtures containing phosphatidic acid is given by electron microscopy. Addition of polylysine leads to a change in the surface curvature of the bound charged lipid. The domain size is estimated from the electron micrographs. The number of domains present is dependent on both the ratio of charged to uncharged lipids as well as on the amount of polylysine added to the vesicles. The size of the domains is not dependent on membrane composition. However, the size seems to increase in a stepwise manner that is correlated with a multiple of the area covered by one polylysine molecule.",
    "output": "The shift in the hyperfine coupling constant observed when polylysine binds to phosphatidic acid is from 16.5 to 14.6 Oe. This change suggests a conformational shift in polylysine from a random coil to a partially ordered configuration upon binding to phosphatidic acid."

Plasma membranes isolated from ethanolamine-supplemented cells had greater viscosities than membranes isolated from choline-supplemented cells.

However, upon the addition of bivalent, but not monovalent, antihapten antibodies, the phospholipid underwent a rapid temperature-dependent redistribution, forming small patches that eventually coalesced into one or more large aggregates. This unexpected finding is discussed in terms of the mode of insertion of the lipid into the cell surface and the possible mechanisms by which bivalent ligands might alter the mobility and distribution of cell surface phospholipids.",

    "input": "It is reported on 3 patients of medical profession who suffered from anaphylactic complications after the patch test with penicilline G, aminophenazone and promethazinhydrochloride. The triggering of the IgE mediated allergy is explained by the quick and complete epidermal penetration of the haptens because their low molecular weight and optimal solubility. It could be proved by the positive mast cell degranulation test, whereas the IgE level was elevated in serum only in one case, but in tissue in no case. Prophylactically, if the careful exploration is positive, the open patch test is indicated. It should carried out in the clinic or ambulance with consecutive observation of the patients for 60 min and with the possibility of the treatment of shock.",
    "output": "Patients should be observed for 60 minutes after an open patch test is carried out in a clinic or ambulance, as per the provided context. This is due to the potential risk of anaphylactic complications, especially with haptens like penicilline G, aminophenazone, and promethazinhydrochloride, which have a low molecular weight and optimal solubility, allowing for quick and complete epidermal penetration. During this observation period, there should be the possibility of treating shock if necessary."

A study to determine the origin of contact dermatitis secondary to topical therapy was conducted among 87 patients with this kind of contact dermatitis. Sixteen patch tests with chemical compounds known to be allergenic were done. The following eight chemical compounds were responsible for 86.5% of the positive reactions observed: neomycin, ethylenediamine, mercury, benzocaine, iodochlorhydroxyquin, peruvian balsam, nitrofurazone and cinchocaine. More than half of the reactions were to neomycin, ethylenediamine and mercury. It is easier to diagnose this condition if one knows the composition of the topical medications one prescribes and the allergenic potency of their ingredients.",

Nine common pollen and environmental allergens were used at three log dilutions for in vivo studies utilizing small volumes of blood (15-20 ml). The clinical evaluation was correlated with the results of the histamine release. two different procedures were utilized. The first is the commonly used histamine release from washed leukocytes. There was excellent correlation between the clinical evaluation and the results of histamine release from washed leukocytes in 17 different individuals. The second and simpler method utilized whole heparinized blood which might better reflect the immunologic reaction which occurs in vivo. Aliquots of blood and allergen were incubated for 1 hr at 37 degrees C and each supernatant was then analyzed for histamine release. There was excellent correlation between the two tests in 29 patients tested by both the whole blood and washed leukocyte methods. There was also good correlation between the clinical evaluation of the patients amd the intro tests.

Compositions of patch tests series varies with regard to the individual substances included: allergens with low sensitizing potency (methol, resorcin, methylsalicylate (!), hexachlorophene, iodochlorhydrooxychinoline) are gradually replaced by others of more recent importance, e.g. mercury (Merfen). Some allergens give better results when tested in higher concentration (balsams of peru, parabens, colophony and wool fat alcohols). Our findings correspond widely with the recommendations of the ICDRG (International Contact Dermatitis Research Group). Therapeutic possibilities are limited; topical application of corticosteroids may be taken as routine regimen. Bufexamac (Parfenac) has been proposed for this purpose, recently. Protective creams (like ion exchange ointments) are of limited use due to the necessity of repeated application.",

Positive reactions to one or more test compounds were recorded in 177 patients. The main offenders among drugs were neomycin, sulphonamide and promethazine; among the excipients, they were parabens, lanolins and benzoyl peroxide. Frequent reactions were observed to certain substances of the 'para' group, benzocaine, diaminodiphenylmethane, aniline and paraphenylendiamine, with the first three acting mainly as indicators of cross-sensitization. The extension and spread of allergic dermatitis can also be produced by drugs administered systematically. Recognition of the allergens responsible for allergic contact dermatitis arising at the lower leg site is a necessary condition if chronicity and spread of the dermatitis are to be prevented. For the same reason it is important to restrict topical applications to non-allergic substances.",

The frequency of positive reactions to patch testing with \"common contact allergens\" was found to be lower in patients with \"high IgE values\" than in those with IgE less than or equal to 1000 U/ml. A larger number of patients with severe dermatitis reacted negatively to PPD and were more difficult to sensitize with DNCB and NDMA as compared with the patients with mild dermatitis. The results of this investigation support the findings of earlier workers that patients with atopic dermatitis show disturbances in the cell-mediated immune system and these disturbances appear to be correlated to the degree of severity of the dermatitis.",

This suggests that the cell-mediated immune response in patients with severe dermatitis may be impaired or less responsive to these allergens compared to those with mild dermatitis."

    "instruction": "What is the most probable hypothesis involving the physiopathological mechanisms of immuno-allergic sensitization?",
    "input": "Among the allergic accidents due to drugs, three clinical syndromes with brutal onset and acute evolution can occur. They are thrombocytopenic purpura, agranulocytosis and hemolytic anemia. An association of two or three syndromes is rare. The occurrence of these cytopenias resulting from an immuno-allergic process is due to a previous sensitization caused by a drug which, in the course of later treatment, would be able to induce an hematological accident in these sensitized subjects. These allergies always involve the formation of serum antibodies in sensitized subjects, the specific activity of which appears on the different cellular types in the presence of the drug responsible or of chemically related products. The specificity of allergic antibodies has been studied. Cross-reactions of these antibodies against products with a chemical formula close to that of the drug responsible have been observed. The physiopathological mechanisms of immuno-allergic sensitization are still uncertain. The most probable hypothesis involves the fixation of soluble complexes on to target cells. Further complement fixation would lead to a possible protection against these cytopenias.",
    "output": "The most probable hypothesis involving the physiopathological mechanisms of immuno-allergic sensitization, as described in the context, suggests that the formation of soluble complexes between the drug, antibodies, and target cells plays a significant role. This complex formation might lead to complement fixation, which could potentially protect against the cytopenias (abnormal decreases in certain types of blood cells) observed in drug-induced allergic reactions. However, it's important to note that this is a hypothesis and further research may be required to confirm these mechanisms."

    "input": "A contact dermatitis is more often due to skin irritation than to allergic reactions. About 80% of occupational dermatoses are explicable as toxic reactions of the skin, 20% as allergic reactions. Frequency and severity of the diseases depends on the nature and concentration of a substance as well as from the duration of its action on the skin. Defense mechanisms against chemicals are influenced by sebum content, humidity and the integrity of the horny layer. From a practical standpoint it is important to differentiate toxic from allergic reactions in a patch-test. It seems that allergic reactions are diagnosed too often. The determination of the critical non-toxic concentration requires the evaluation of a sufficient number of patients. The differentiation of irritation and allergy is tendered more difficult by individual factors. The therapy of toxic and allergic contact dermatitis is discussed.",

Immediate cutaneous reactions to testing with PPD appeared in all age groups and occurred in nonatopic patients but were more common in atopic patients (p less than 0.005). Delayed cutaneous reactions to testing with PPD occurred in only three out of 76 patients with immediate reactivity. Antihistaminic suppression of immediate reactivity was not followed by evidence of delayed cutaneous reactivity. In vitro tests of lymphocytic stimulation revealed indices of stimulation with PPD to be similar both in patients with immediate and delayed cutaneous reactivity. Failure to manifest delayed cutaneous reactivity following immediate cutaneous reactions alone may be explained by antigen-antibody binding and phagocytosis, by suppressor T-lymphocytes, or by impaired release or lack of response to T-lymphocytic mediators. Adverse reactions to administration of BCG vaccine in patients with immediate cutaneous reactivity might be anticipated.",

The following conclusions have been reached: tuberculosis with germs showing primary drug resistance did not display onset modalities, clinically and radiologically, that differed significantly from other types of tuberculosis; sputum conversion is more slow in patients with resistant germs than in those with sensitive germs in the first two months of treatment, but following application of the treatment according to the data resulting from the antibiogram, this differences quickly disappeared. The presence of a smaller number of complete recoveries and of a surplus of doubtful recoveries can be explained in the same way in this group of patients: the final results are similar in both groups of patients, evidencing that the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis due to germs showing parimary drug resistance does not give rise to particular problems.",

Many difficulties have been met in the differential diagnosis between pulmonary tuberculosis and bronchogenic carcinoma in those cases with anamnestic and radiological data of previous pulmonary tuberculosis. When the radiological site of lesions was in the posterior segments of the lung, tuberculosis was the most probable diagnosis, while bronchogenic carcinoma is most oftenly localized in the anterior segments; only in 5 cases of the Author's series the above mentioned criterion was not satisfied.

    "input": "The effects of acute and chronic ethanol intake on the startle response was examined in male rats. Ethanol given IP produced a dose-dependent decrease in the amplitude of the startle response measured 30 min later. With a dose of 1 g/kg, the effect was evident at 15 min and had recovered substantially by 60 min. The effect of ethanol on the startle response was potentiated by pretreatment of the animals with pimozide, haloperidol, and p-chlorophenylalanine but not by propranolol, phenoxybenzamine, alpha-methyltyrosine, or pargyline. After 3 weeks on an ethanol-containing diet, the startle response was greater than that shown by rats on the control iso-caloric, sucrose-containing diet. After ethanol withdrawal, the startle response was further increased, with a peak about 9 to 12 hr after discontinuation of ethanol; thereafter, the response declined. This time course of heightened startle response during ethanol withdrawal corresponds to the time course of the activation of noradrenergic neurons during withdrawal. It appears that dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons are involved in the mediation of the startle response in rats.",
    "output": "The effect of a 1 g/kg dose of ethanol on the startle response in male rats, 60 min later, is a substantial recovery of the startle response as compared to the initial decrease observed 30 min later. However, it's important to note that the response is not completely back to the baseline level, as the effect was still evident at this time point. This recovery is in contrast to the heightened startle response observed during ethanol withdrawal, which peaks about 9 to 12 hours after discontinuation of ethanol.

Ethanol was given i.p. in doses of 0.69, 1.7, and 3.0 g/kg in equal volumes (20 ml/kg). The liver was freeze-clamped 120 min after injection, and multiple metabolites were measured in the perchloric acid extract of the tissue. Each group showed a significantly different pattern of metabolites, redox states, and phosphorylation potentials although the rate of ethanol disappearance, at least between the two highest dose groups, was not significantly different. The mitochondrial free [NAD+]/[NADH] ratios and the cytoplasmic free [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio were paradoxically most reduced with the lowest dose of ethanol and became progressively more oxidized with increasing dose. Once established, the differences in these ratios between the groups tended to persist with time, relatively independent of the concentration of ethanol. In a somewhat different pattern, the phosphorylation potential ([ATP]/[ADP][P1]) remained at the control level in the low-dose group but was significantly elevated in the two higher-dose groups. The results, therefore, show distinct and complicated dose-dependent patterns of intermediary metabolism that cannot be explained completely by any one hypothesis but that imply significant dose-dependent effects of ethanol upon intermediary metabolism not directly related to NADH production.",

    "instruction": "What is the effect of chronic alcoholism on the serum albumin levels and how does it impact the distribution of certain drugs, such as diazepam?",
    "input": "Ethanol and drugs can affect each other's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. When ingested together, ethanol can increase drug absorption by enhancing the gastric solubility of drugs and by increasing gastrointestinal blood flow. However, high concentrations of ethanol induce gastric irritation causing a pyloric spasm which in turn may delay drug absorption and/or reduce bioavailability. The 'quality' of the alcoholic beverage, independent of its ethanol content, can contribute to altered absorption of a drug. Ethanol is not bound to plasma proteins extensively enough to modify drug distribution. However, serum albumin levels in chronic alcoholics may be abnormally low so that some drugs, e.g. diazepam, have an increased volume of distribution. In addition to the amount ingested, the duration of regular intake determines the effect of ethanol on drug metabolism. Acute intake of ethanol inhibits the metabolism of many drugs but long term intake of ethanol at a high level (greater than 200g of pure ethanol per day) can induce liver enzymes to metabolise drugs more efficiently. At the present time there are no accurate means, with the possible exception of liver biopsy, to clinically predict the capacity of an alcoholic to metabolise drugs. Several drugs can inhibit the metabolism of ethanol at the level of alcohol dehydrogenase. Individual predisposition determines the severity of this drug-ethanol interaction. During its absorption phase, ethanol inhibits the secretion of antidiuretic hormone and is also able to induce increased excretion of a drug through the kidneys. However, chronic alcoholics with water retention may show reduced excretion of drugs via this route. At the pharmacodynamic level, ethanol can enhance the deleterious effects of sedatives, certain anxiolytics, sedative antidepressants and antipsychotics and anticholinergic agents, on performance. Mechanisms of lethal interactions between moderate overdoses of ethanol and anxiolytics/opiates/sedatives are poorly understood. On the other hand, certain peptides, 'nonspecific' stimulants, dopaminergic agents and opiate antagonists can antagonise alcohol-induced inebriation to a significant degree.",
    "output": "Chronic alcoholism can have a significant impact on serum albumin levels and the distribution of certain drugs, such as diazepam. Chronic alcoholism often leads to a decrease in serum albumin levels due to malnutrition, liver disease, and other factors associated with long-term alcohol abuse. This decrease in serum albumin can cause an increased volume of distribution for drugs like diazepam, which are highly protein-bound. This means that a larger amount of the drug is needed to achieve the same effect in the body, leading to decreased drug efficacy.\n\nIn terms of drug metabolism, acute intake of ethanol can inhibit the metabolism of many drugs, while long-term intake at high levels can induce liver enzymes to metabolize drugs more efficiently. However, it is difficult to predict the exact effect of alcohol on drug metabolism in individual cases, and liver biopsy is currently the only accurate means of determining the capacity of an alcoholic to metabolize drugs.\n\nOverall, the effects of chronic alcoholism on drug distribution and metabolism can be complex and vary depending on factors such as the specific drug being used, the individual's alcohol consumption history, and other health factors. It is important for healthcare providers to consider these factors when prescribing medications to patients with a history of alcohol abuse."

    "instruction": "What happens to striatal dopamine release at high doses of ethanol?",
    "input": "Acute and chronic ethanol treatment has multiple effects on the neurotransmitter systems in the nigrostriatal complex. A single dose of ethanol increases striatal dopamine release at low doses, but depresses it at high doses. In ethanol-dependent rats, dopamine release is accelerated during intoxication, but is reduced during a withdrawal syndrome. Concomitantly, high-affinity choline uptake, an index of cholinergic activity, is elevated at times when dopamine release is depressed. Changes in dopaminergic or cholinergic receptor activity do not induce or result from these effects. Neither has a role for GABA or substance P yet been implicated. The data suggest that interactions between at least two trasmitters in the caudate nucleus may occur after acute and chronic ethanol treatment.",
    "output": "At high doses of ethanol, there is a depression in striatal dopamine release. This means that the normal amount of dopamine released in the striatum is reduced. This is in contrast to low doses of ethanol, where there is an increase in striatal dopamine release. The exact mechanisms behind this are not fully understood, but it's known that it doesn't involve changes in dopaminergic or cholinergic receptor activity, and neither GABA nor substance P have been implicated yet. The interactions between at least two transmitters in the caudate nucleus may occur after acute and chronic ethanol treatment."

    "instruction": "What was the effect of heavy intoxication on the labeling of brain microsomal lipids and proteolipids in acute experiments?",
    "input": "The experiments described are based on the hypothesis that prolongation of the depressant action of ethanol leads to compensatory changes in neuronal membrane structures involved in impulse conduction and transmission, and that these become manifest as increased tolerance and withdrawal hyperexcitability. Behavioral tolerance was tested by means of the tilted plane test in rats consuming 9-10 g ethanol/kg/day in a liquid diet fed ad lib., or given 5 g/kg every other day by stomach tube, or doses rising from 6 to 9 g/kg/day maintaining continuous intoxication. All treatments were continued for about three or four weeks before testing. Rats consuming ethanol at a self-regulated rate did not develop tolerance, evidently because sufficient alcohol levels were not built up. Prolonged intoxication induced a high degree of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms, whereas intoxication every other day induced an intermediate degree of tolerance. When no definite abstinence symptoms were associated with the behavioral tolerance, cation stimulated ATPase activity of the brain microsomal fraction was not changed. With increasing withdrawal excitability, there was a relative increase in Na+, K+-stimulated ATPase and an decrease in Mg2+-stimulated ATPase whereas total activity of the enzyme system was not altered. 14C-serine was used as a precursor in order to detect changes in the metabolism of membrane components. So far, only acute experiments have been carried out in vivo. Heavy intoxication (6 g ethanol/kg by stomach tube) inhibited labeling of brain microsomal lipids and proteolipids. In \"hangover\", proteolipid labeling had returned to the control level whereas lipid labeling was still depressed. Cerebral cortex slices from rats in a withdrawal state after prolonged intoxication, and from control rats, were incubated in vitro with 14C-serine. Unstimulated tissue showed no effect of the prior treatment. When electrical stimulation was applied, much more activity was recovered in microsomal lipids of slices from withdrawal animals than from controls.",
    "output": "Heavy intoxication in acute experiments was found to inhibit the labeling of brain microsomal lipids and proteolipids. However, in the state of \"hangover\", proteolipid labeling had returned to the control level, while lipid labeling was still depressed. This suggests that the effects on lipids may persist longer than those on proteolipids during recovery from heavy intoxication."

    "input": "In the rat hypothalamus, histamine content and histidine decarboxylas: activity are enhanced significantly after acute administration (80--160 mg/100g body weight) of ethanol. The effects are less pronounced after chronic treatment (15% v/v in drinking water for 4 weeks). Histamine methyltransferase is unaffected in either case. In hypothalamic slices preloaded with 3H-histamine and superfused with amine free solution the basal and K+-induced efflux of 3H-histamine are inhibited by alcohol. The inhibition of histamine release along with the increased levels of histamine may play an important role in the central effects of alcohol.",
    "output": "The effect of ethanol on histamine methyltransferase in the rat hypothalamus is not significantly affected. However, acute administration of ethanol (80-160 mg/100g body weight) increases the content and activity of histamine in the hypothalamus, while chronic treatment (15% v/v in drinking water for 4 weeks) has less pronounced effects. The inhibition of histamine release by alcohol may play a role in the central effects of alcohol."

    "input": "In mice chronically treated with ethanol (in a liquid diet containing 6% ethanol ad libitum for 2 weeks), brain tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) activity was increased (by 30-45% in whole brain), while brain tyrosine hydroxylase activity remained unchanged. Such chronic ethanol treatment also induced susceptibility to audiogenic seizures during withdrawal (60% incidence). When ethanol treatment was given to adrenalectomized (Adx) mice, the increase of brain TPH activity and the development of withdrawal audiogenic seizures were both prevented. In Adx mice receiving daily injections of corticosterone (0.5 mg/mouse), the ethanol-induced increase of brain TPH activity and the occurrence of withdrawal audiogenic seizures were both restored. Similarly, the ethanol-induced increase of liver alcohol dehydrogenase activity (by 60%) was prevented in Adx mice and restored by corticosterone replacement. It was noted that in all three cases replacement with such large doses of the corticoid did not enhance the ethanol effects, but merely restored the effects to the levels observed in intact mice. Apparently, glucocorticoids are required in a permissive role in order for the ethanol effects to occur.",

No changes were observed in plasma cholesterol and beta-lipoprotein levels. A transient, three-fold increase of TG concentrations occurred in liver biopsy specimens. Ultrastructural and cytochemical examinations of the biopsy specimens showed hyperplasia of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and increased canallicular activity of gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT) activity in most subjects towards the end of and after the ethanol intake period.

Groups of 10 to 22 male albino Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were individually implanted s.c. with either two 75-mg morphine base pellets or two placebo pellets. After 72 hr, chlorpromazine (CPZ 1,2 and 4 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg), thioridazine (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (2,4 and 8 mg/kg), diazepam (DPM, 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg) or vehicle was injected s.c. 55 min before precipitation of abstinence with naloxone (1 mg/kg s.c.). Jumping was exacerbated by CPZ (4 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (4 and 8 mg/kg) and DPM (1, 2 and 4 mg/kg); haloperidol and thioridazine had no significant effect on this sign. Weight less over 1 hr was decreased by CPZ (4 mg/kg) and DPM (4 mg/kg). Wet-dog shakes were decreased by all doses of haloperidol but increased by chlordiazepoxide (8 mg/kg) and DPM (1, 2 and 4 mg/kg). CPZ (2 and 4 mg/kg) significantly increased the incidence of teeth chattering. Other abstinence signs were not affected in a dose-related manner. Although the antipsychotic agents each decrease dopamine availability at the postsynaptic receptor, this mechanism alone cannot explain their actions on individual signs of abstinence. Perhaps it is therefore time to question how modifying agents can be meaningfully compared in morphine-abstinent rats.",

Druing this period the circling response to apomorphine hydrochloride (0.01-0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) was increasingly suppressed in comparison to control animals, while spontaneous locomotor activity increased. Following drug withdrawal the circling response to apomorphine remained suppressed two months later. However, spontaneous locomotor activity was also reduced up to 1 month following drug removal. The dopamine content of the lesioned side of the forebrain was 25% of the intact side in control animals and was not further reduced by amphetamine administration. The dopamine content of the intact forebrain was reduced by 43% during amphetamine administration and remained 18% depressed 1 month following drug withdrawal. No changes in 5-hydroxytryptamine or noradrenaline concentrations were observed in either the intact or lesioned side.

    "instruction": "What effect did naloxone have when given alone on dopamine turnover in the brain areas studied?",
    "input": "The is evidence that some of the actions of both endogenous and exogenous opioids (e.g., stimulation of prolactin release) are mediated by interaction with catecholaminergic systems. Morphine (1.67, 5, and 15 mg/kg of body weight, intraperitoneally) altered dopamine turnover as measured by the alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine method in the median eminence, neostriatum, and frontal cortex of male Sprague-Dawley rats. The turnover rate of dopamine was reduced in the median eminence and frontal cortex but accelerated in the neostriatum. In the frontal cortex all doses were effective in decreasing dopamine turnover; however, in the median eminence the lowest dose of morphine did not significantly alter dopamine turnover. All three doses accelerated dopamine turnover in the neostriatum. Naloxone effectively reversed the effects of morphine at all doses in all brain areas, whereas it had no effect on turnover when given alone. In the median eminence, neostriatum, and frontal cortex, intraventricular injection of [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]-enkephalin (25 micrograms) or beta-endorphin (15 micrograms) produced the same effects on dopamine turnover as morphine. The actions of these peptides were blocked by naloxone. It is hypothesized that opiates and opioid peptides increase prolactin release by reducing the activity of the tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic system.",
    "output": "Naloxone, when given alone, did not have any significant effect on dopamine turnover in the brain areas studied (median eminence, neostriatum, and frontal cortex). However, when naloxone was used to reverse the effects of morphine, it effectively reversed the alterations in dopamine turnover that morphine caused in all these brain areas. This suggests that the effects of morphine on dopamine turnover are mediated by opioid receptors, and that naloxone, an opioid antagonist, can reverse these effects."

Subsequently to the chronic blockade of muscarinic or serotonergic receptors, the intensity of tolerance was unaffected, but some manifestations of the abstinence behavior induced by naloxone were reduced in part. This attenuation of the abstinence syndrome in the pretreated mice was reverted by an additional dose of either atropine or methysergide administered a few min before naloxone. Additional experiments with physostigmine or 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) in morphine-dependent mice yielded results compatible with the hypothesis that morphine physical dependence may be the manifestation of compensatory changes of sensitivity to serotonin and acetylcholine in the CNS. These results do not exclude the participation of other neurotransmitters or neurohormones in morphine dependence.",

Only with a very high dose (16 mg/kg) of this drug did the effect seem related to an interference with memory formation processes. Of the dopamine receptor-blocking agents used, haloperidol (0.125--1 mg/kg), but not chlorpromazine or clozapine (0.25--4 mg/kg), prevented the apomorphine effect. Phenoxybenzamine (8 mg/kg), a noradrenaline receptor-blocker, antagonized the haloperidol effect and, when combined with a subeffective dose of apomorphine, impaired passive avoidance learning. The results obtained are interpreted in terms of the proposed inhibitory actions exerted by central noradrenaline on dopamine systems of the brain.",

However, at 1 mg/kg, a dose which also produces blockade of NA receptors, pimozide counteracted the increase in waking elicited by (+)-amphetamine. 4 Spiroperidol (1 to 4 mg/kg) which is devoided of NA receptor blocking properties, failed to reverse the L-DOPA or (+)-amphetamine-induced arousal. 5 Our results suggest that the increased waking time observed after the catecholamine agonists is related to an increased availability of NA rather than dopamine.",

It was observed that: 1) parachlorophenylalanine prolonged the anticataleptic action of ephedrine and, in part also, that of amphetamine, 2) methysergide alone exerted an anticataleptic effect and enhanced somewhat the same effect of both psychostimulating drugs used, 3) d, 1-tryptophan increased the intensity of catalepsy and reduced very significantly or abolished completely the anticataleptic action of ephedrine and amphetamine. These results support the view that the serotonin system exerts a suppressing effect on the central effects resulting from stimulation of catecholamine dependent functions.",
    "output": "The context suggests that methysergide enhanced the anticataleptic effect of both amphetamine and ephedrine, meaning it potentiated or increased their ability to counteract catalepsy (a motor disability resembling catatonia in humans).

These These two measures were generally found to parallel excepting when the interacting agent caused muscular hypotonia. All potential interacting agents were given as pretreatments to determine changes in motor function which may interfere with the climbing induced by 1.0 mg/kg s.c. apomorphine. The possibility of a change in the apomorphine response to a sterotyped biting, which would also interfere with climbing, was also considered. Excluding these non-specific changes, climbing behaviour was shown to be antagonised, dose-dependently, by low doses of typical and atypical neuroleptic agents (haloperidol, fluphenazine, loxapine, pimozide, oxiperomide, clozapin, thioridazine, sulpiride, tiapride and metoclopramide) but not specifically by other psychoactive agents. Climbing behaviour was modified by serotonergic agents; the agonist quipazine reduced or abolished, whilst the antagonists, methysergide and cyproheptadine, enhanced the response. Picrotoxin specifically reduced climbing behaviour but sodium valproate exerted non-specific effects, precluding conclusions as to a GABA involvement. Cholinergic and noradrenergic involvements with climbing were also apparently eliminated by the ineffectiveness of atropine, aceperone, piperoxan and propranolol. The involvement of serotonin with climbing was extended to the actions of the neuroleptics: the antagonistic effects of typical neuroleptics (haloperidol, fluphenazine, loxapine) were markedly enhanced by combination with methysergide or cyproheptadine whilst the effects of clozapine, sulpiride and thioridazine were significantly reduced. The actions of metoclopramide, oxiperomide, pimozide and tiapride were not generally modified by such combinations. These differences are discussed in terms of differential abilities to induce extrapyramidal disturbances and the mouse climbing model is forwarded as a test with potential to detect antipsychotic agents of different activity spectra.",
    "output": "The serotonergic agonist quipazine had an effect of reducing or abolishing the climbing behavior induced by apomorphine in mice. This suggests that serotonin plays a role in regulating the climbing response induced by apomorphine. The antagonists, methysergide and cyproheptadine, on the other hand, enhanced the climbing response, indicating that they may have an opposite effect on the serotonin system."

The subcutaneous administration of 10 mg/kg of morphine-HC1 produced a marked increase in locomotor activity in mice. The morphine-induced hyperactivity was potentiated by scopolamine and attenuated by physostigmine. In contrast, both methscopolamine and neostigmine, which do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, had no effect on the hyperactivity produced by morphine. Pretreatment of mice with alpha-methyltyrosine (20 mg/kg i.p., one hour), an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase, significantly decreased the activity-increasing effects of morphine. On the other hand, pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalamine (3 X 320 mg/kg i.p., 24 hr), a serotonin depletor, caused no significant change in the hyperactivity. The study suggests that the activity-increasing effects of morphine are mediated by the release of catecholamines from adrenergic neurons in the brain. And the results are consistent with the hypothesis that morphine acts by retarding the release of acetylcholine at some central cholinergic synapses. It is also suggested from collected evidence that the activity-increasing effects of morphine in mice are mediated by mechanisms different from those which mediate the activity-increasing effects of morphine in rats.",

The remainder were considered to have the urethral syndrome. Neither pyuria, microscopic bacteriuria, nor any single subjective or objective datum definitively predicted cystitis at the initial visit. Therefore, we advise formulating the problem as \"dysuria\" at the initial evaluation even though one treats with an antimicrobial. The initial workup should include a routine urinalysis, gram stain of the urinary sediment, urine culture, an examination of the urethra and labia as well as a urethral culture. Complete pelvic examination is useful in documenting gonorrhea, herpes progenitalis or vaginitis. If the pelvic examination is deferred and the initial urine culture is negative, reevaluation of the dysuria should include a pelvic examination.",
    "output": "The percentage of the 84 women with dysuria who were considered to have the urethral syndrome was the remainder, as mentioned in the context. Since 46% had significant bacteriuria, 8% had gonorrhea, 1% had herpes progenitalis, 17% had monilia and Trichomonas vaginitis, the urethral syndrome would account for the remaining 28% (84 - 46 - 8 - 1 - 17 = 28). However, the text does not explicitly state this percentage, but rather describes the remainder as being classified as having the urethral syndrome."

    "input": "To study the bacterial pathogenesis of acute pelvic inflammatory disease, peritoneal fluid was obtained by culdocentesis in 133 of 344 women with this disease. In 104 of the specimens bacteria were identified both in the gram-stained smear and culture. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was isolated from the lower genital tract in over half of these women, and there were 3 patterns of bacterial recovery from peritoneal fluid: N gonorrhoeae alone (22%), N gonorrhoeae and other organisms (32%), and nongonococcal organisms alone (46%). In women without cervical gonorrhea only nongonococcal organisms were identified from peritoneal fluid. In both groups of women a similar number of nongonococcal organisms were isolated. The results of this study supported those reported prior to availability of antimicrobials and suggest that N gonorrhoeae initiates most cases of pelvic inflammatory disease. A significant number of these women have superinfection with nongonococcal organisms which may preclude recovery of gonococci.",

In the normal women urinary abnormalities were uncommon, but the patients regularly had episodes of bacteriuria and pyuria, only a quarter of which were symptomatic. Symptoms tended to be associated with high white cell excretion rates and with the longer episodes. Introital colonisation was heavier and more frequent in the patients than in the control subjects. Organisms recovered from the urine had previously colonised the introitus in most cases. It appears that symptomatic episodes constitute only a small part of the disease process in patients with recurrent urinary tract infection.",

    "input": "Phenotypic \"revertants\" of a drug resistant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were induced by mutgenesis with manganese. Several of these drug sensitive mutants have been shown to result from mutations in the nuclear genome that cause phenotypic modification (suppression) of the mitochondrially-determined drug resistant genotype. Four mutants carrying a single recessive nuclear gene capable of modifying mitochondrial chloramphenicol resistance are described; these may be assigned to three complementation groups. Chloramphenicol resistant mutants mapping at five separate mitochondrial loci are described. At least two of the nuclear genes cause modification of mitochondrial chloramphenicol resistance determined by mutations at three of these loci, but the other two loci are apparently non-suppressible by these nuclear alleles. This indicates that these modifiers do not act by causing a general decrease in cellular or mitochondrial permeability to the drug. A single dominant nuclear modifier of mitochondrial paromomycin resistance has been identified. It is non-allelic to and does not interact with the genes modifying mitochondrial chloramphenicol resistance.",

Most of these shared diminished ability to utilize arginine, citrulline and/or ornithine as sole nitrogen source. All 29 had reduced levels of the catabolic enzymes arginase and ornithine aminotransferase under various conditions in which these enzymes are induced in the parent. In some circumstances, five of the mutants also showed elevated levels of the biosynthetic enzyme ornithine carbamoyltransferase. On the basis of these data, the 29 mutants were divided into six phenotypic classes; in four of these, control of ornithine carbamoyltransferase was the same as in the wild type, while in the other two it was altered. It is suggested that the isolates carry regulatory mutations, and that certain of these may affect simultaneously the formation of arginine catabolic and biosynthetic enzymes. The implication of the latter is that in B. subtilis, as in yeast, controls of the catabolic and biosynthetic pathways are connected. Single representatives of five of the phenotypic classes carry mutations conferring arginine hydroxamate resistance linked to cysA by transduction with phage PBSI; this did not appear to be true for a representative of the sixth class.",

All the mutants reported in this study fail to be complemented by a rho0 tester derived from a respiratory competent strain. The meiotic spore progeny obtained by mating the mutants to a respiratory competent haploid yeast, when scored for growth on glycerol, show a non-Mendelian segregation of the phenotype.

The ATPase specific activity of plasma and mitochondrial membranes isolated from the mutant strain was approximately 20% lower (P less than 0.001, Tables 1 and 2) than that of membranes isolated from the isogenic parental strain. Additional evidence of altered mitochondrial function was: (i) the enhanced growth of the parental strain was eliminted by the [rho-] state (Table 3); (ii) the mutant strain had a greater resistance to petite induction by ethidium bromide (Table 4); (iii) the mutant strain was unable to use a nonfermentable energy source for respiratory adaptation (Table 5). It is proposed that a single gene mutation has resulted in an alteration of some physiological properties of the plasma and mitochondrial membranes.",

All A and B mutants exhibited a common nutritional pattern. The ATPase-deficient group, when scored for ATPase-binding sites on its membrane particles revealed three different subgroups: (1) mutants having free ATPase-binding sites, (2) mutants with ATPase-binding sites made available by the procedure which releases ATPase from wild-type membrane, and (3) mutants with no detectable ATPase-binding sites. Membranes of the mutant B with unbound ATPase also exhibited a deficiency in ATPase-binding sites, but its soluble ATPase was also found unable to bind to ATPase-binding sites of wild type membranes. The double alteration, namely abnormal or inactive ATPase and absence of ATPase-binding sites on the membrane is compatible with a single mutational defect.",

Both physical factors were more effective than nitrous acid. The selection was complicated by a high instability of isolates, out of which 20-80% (depending on their origin) reversed spontaneously to the parent type. The primary screening (selection of morphological variants and determination of their activity using the method of agar blocks) made it possible to detect only potentially non-productive strains; however, the final selection had to be performed always under submerged conditions. Fifty-four stable non-productive mutants were divided, according to results of the chromatographic analysis, in five groups differing in production of six biologically inactive metabolites (compounds A-H). The mutants did not accumulate chromomycinone, chromocyclomycin and chromocyclin. On mixed cultivation none of the pairs of mutants was capable of cosynthesis of mithramycin or new compounds differing from standard metabolites. Possible causes of the above results are discussed.",

    "input": "Using ICR-170 as a mutagen, we have induced a set of mutations in yeast which exhibit behavior similar to that shown for bacterial frameshift mutations. Our genetic study shows that these mutations are polar; the polarity can be relieved by internal suppressors; they revert with acridine half-mustards and are not suppressed by known nonsense suppressors. However, they are suppressed by other dominant external suppressors, which fall into two mutually exclusive groups. Five genetically distinct suppressors were obtained for one of these groups, using co-reversion of two frameshift markers. Three of these are lethal in combination with each other and show a reduction in the GLY3 tRNA peak on a Sepharose 4B column. A fourth suppressor shows an altered chromatographic profile for GLY1 tRNA. We suggest that this group of suppressors represent mutations in the structural genes for the isoaccepting glycyl-tRNA's. Two other suppressors (one linked to the centromere of chromosome III) were found to suppress a second group of frameshifts. Genetic and biochemical studies show that the nonMendelian factor (PSI+) increases the efficiency of some frameshift suppressors.",
    "output": "The type of tRNA peak that is reduced in combination with the lethal suppressors on a Sepharose 4B column is the GLY3 tRNA peak. This suggests that these suppressors may be related to the structural genes for the isoaccepting glycyl-tRNA's."

    "input": "Mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae resistant to the antibiotic mucidin, a specific inhibitor of electron transport between cytochrome b and c, were isolated and divided into three phenotypic groups, as follows. Class 1 mutants were cross-resistant to a variety of mitochondrial inhibitors and exhibited no resistance at the mitochondrial level. Class 2 mutants were specifically resistant to mucidin exhibiting resistance also at the level of isolated mitochondria. Biochemical studies indicated that the mucidin resistance in class 2 mutants involved a modification of mucidin binding of inhibitory sites on the mitochondrial inner membrane without a significance change in the sensitivity of mitochondrial oxygen uptake to antimycin A, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, and 2,3-dimercaptopropanol. Class 3 was represented by a mutant which showed a high degree of resistance to mucidin and was cross-resistant to a variety of mitochondrial inhibitors at the cellular level but exhibited only a resistance to mucidin at the mitochondrial level. Genetic analysis of mucidin-resistant mutants revealed the presence of both nuclear and mitochondrial genes determining mucidin resistance/sensitivity in yeast. Resistance to mucidin in class 1 mutants was due to a single-gene nuclear recessive mutation (mucPR) whereas that in class 2 mutants was caused by mutations of mitochondrial genes. Resistance in class 3 mutant was determined both by single-gene nuclear and mitochondrial mutations. In the mitochondrial mutants the mucidin resistance segregated mitotically and the resistance determinant was lost upon induction of petite mutation by ethidium bromide. Allelism tests indicated that the mucidin resistance mutations fell into two genetic loci (MUC1 and MUC2) which were apparently not closely linked in the mitochondrial genome. Recombination studies showed that the two mitochondrial mucidin loci were not allelic with other mitochondrial loci RIB1, RIB2 and OLI1. An extremely high mucidin resistance at the cellular level was shown to arise from synergistic interaction of the nuclear gene mucPR and the mitochondrial mucidin-resistance gene (MR) in a cell. The results suggest that at least two mitochondrial gene products, responsible for mucidin resistance/sensitivity in yeast, take part in the formation of the cytochrome bc1 region of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.",
    "output": "The mutation responsible for mucidin resistance in class 1 mutants is a single-gene nuclear recessive mutation, specifically referred to as mucPR. This mutation is different from the mutations causing resistance in class 2 mutants, which are due to mutations of mitochondrial genes. Class 3 mutants, on the other hand, exhibit resistance determined by both single-gene nuclear and mitochondrial mutations."

    "input": "Mutants with defective carbon catabolite repression have been isolated in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a selective procedure. This was based on the fact that invertase is a glucose repressible cell wall enzyme which slowly hydrolyses raffinose to yield fructose and that the inhibitory effects of 2-deoxyglucose can be counteracted by fructose. Repressed cells were plated on a raffinose--2-doexyglucose medium and the resistant cells growing up into colonies were tested for glucose non-repressible invertase and maltase. The yield of regulatory mutants was very high. All were equally derepressed for invertase and maltase, no mutants were obtained with only non-repressible invertase synthesis which was the selected function. A total of 61 mutants isolated in different strains were allele tested and could be attributed to three genes. They were all recessive. Mutants in one gene had reduced hexokinase activities, the other class, located in a centromere linked gene, had elevated hexokinase levels and was inhibited by maltose. Mutants in a third gene were isolated on a 2-deoxyglucose galactose medium and had normal hexokinase levels. A partial derepression was observed for malate dehydrogenase in all mutants. Isocitrate lyase, however, was still fully repressible.",
    "output": "The enzyme that was used as the basis for the selective procedure to isolate mutants with defective carbon catabolite repression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was not explicitly mentioned in the context provided. However, the context suggests that the selective procedure was based on the enzyme invertase, as the resistance to 2-deoxyglucose and growth on a raffinose--2-deoxyglucose medium were used to identify resistant cells, which were then tested for glucose non-repressible invertase. Nonetheless, it's important to note that invertase was not the only enzyme involved in the mutants' characteristics, as changes in hexokinase, malate dehydrogenase, and isocitrate lyase activities were also observed. Therefore, the exact enzyme used as the basis for the selective procedure is not entirely clear from the given context."

The clinico-virological correlation led to a simple diagnostic and therapeutic scheme which is applicable by the ophthalmologist in his office without virological confirmation: 1. Superficial viral herpes (dendritic keratitis and allied disorders), HSV-isolating rate 96%. 2. Stromal herpes (disciform edema, different types of interstitial herpetic keratitis), only sporadical findings of HSV in the lacrimal fluid. The rate of virus-recovery increases, however, when an interstitial herpetic keratitis ulcerates. 3. Metaherpetic corneal disease = chronic or chronic recurrent superficial postherpetic disease without any detectable HSV-activity (main types: metaherpetic erosion, metaherpetic ulcer, metaherpetic bullous keratopathy). One of four superficial herpetic corneal diseases proved to be nonviral, i.e. metaherpetic in our series. Metaherpetic diseases may be widely considered as a therapeutic entity.

Being aware of the diagnostic criteria and taking advantage of a combined soft lens therapy the treatment of metaherpetic corneal disease is easier and more successful than commonly accepted.",

    "input": "Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 were used to infect rabbit corneas (without abrasion), and the resulting lesions were compared by light and electron microscopy. The type 1-induced lesion developed more quickly; the infected epithelial cells underwent a progression of defined morphological changes leading to organelle destruction, cell rounding, and death. Virus particles were abundant in the nuclei and cytoplasm of all types of cell in the epithelium, in intercellular spaces, and on the basement membrane. Occasionally, virus was seen to replicate within stromal fibroblasts. In contrast, type 2, although causing similar changes in the epithelial cells, was relatively inefficient in the production of mature virions. Thus type 2 nucleocapsids were synthesized within nuclei in numbers comparable to those of types 1, but intact cytoplasmic virions were uncommon, apparently because of degradation of type 2 virions in cytoplasmic vesicles or tubules. Extracellular type 2 particles were rarely seen. This finding offers an explanation for the relatively slow development of the type 2-induced lesion, but not for its greater severity. All epithelial cells appeared to be capable of supporting replication of either type of virus.",
    "output": "Virus particles were abundant in the nuclei and cytoplasm of all types of cell in the epithelium, in intercellular spaces, and on the basement membrane during type 1-induced lesions. However, in type 2 infections, while virus particles were also produced in the nuclei, they were less abundant in the cytoplasm due to degradation of type 2 virions in cytoplasmic vesicles or tubules, which may explain the slower development of type 2-induced lesions."

Therefore, we sought to correlate clinical susceptibility to two herpesvirus (simplex and zoster) infections with specific cellular immunity, assessed by the transformation and interferon responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to heat-inactivated antigens. Transformation and interferon response to herps simplex virus was maximally depressed immediately after transplantation, the time when severe and prolonged infection with herps simplex virus occurred. Six months to six years after transplantation, both clinical susceptibility and cellular immunity to herpes simplex virus were normal. Herpes zoster infections were more frequent than normal at all times after cardiac transplantation; depressed or absent cellular responses to the varicella zoster virus paralleled that susceptibility. In these patients the risk of severe herpesvirus infections correlated with depressed cellular immune responses to the specific viral agent involved.",

    "input": "Herpes simplex infections of the perianal skin and anal canal are not uncommon, as evidenced by the present series of 16 cases, but have rarely been reported in the literature of the past. They are caused by the HSV-2 virus, which is also associated with genital lesions. There is abundant evidence that anogenital herpes is a venereal disease. Anal herpes is most commonly transmitted by anal intercourse. When the infection is present inside the anal canal, especially in a primary attack, the pain can be quite dibilitating. The diagnosis can usually be made on clinical grounds by recognizing the typical vesicles or aphthous ulcers, together with inguinal lymphadenopathy. The disease is self-limiting, but may be recurrent. Asymptomatic homosexuals may represent a large reservoir of the disease, which appears to be on the increase in our society. Cytology, immunofluorescence, viral cultures and serologic tests can be used for laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis. Newer methods of treatment with vaccine containing heat-inactivated virus, and use of photoinactivation following topical application of heterotricyclic dyes, show promise.",

Cytology: Exfoliated cells from the lesions can be examined under a microscope for the presence of multinucleated giant cells, which are characteristic of herpes simplex virus infection.\n\n2. Immunofluorescence: This technique uses antibodies specific to herpes simplex virus to identify the virus in the cells taken from the lesions.\n\n3. Viral Cultures: Lesion material can be taken and cultured to isolate and identify the herpes simplex virus.\n\n4. Serologic Tests: These tests measure the presence of antibodies to the herpes simplex virus in the blood, which can indicate a past or current infection. However, these tests may not be useful in the acute phase of the infection as it takes time for the body to produce detectable levels of antibodies."

Paradoxically, all those subject to recurrent herpetic infections had, without exception, evidence of cell-mediated immunity to herpes antigens. This was demonstrated by lymphocyte transformation and specific 51Cr release from infected human amnion cells after incubation with peripheal blood mononuclear cells. Where performed, skin tests with herpes antigen were also positive. In addition, serum from these patients specifically sensitized herpesvirus-infected cells to killing by nonimmune, control mononuclear cells. These tests were negative in the control patients except in a few cases, and it is suggested that these latter may be the asymptomatic herpesvirus carriers previously recognized or that they may have experienced a genital infection.",

    "instruction": "What was the effect of glucose at 5 mM on amino acid-induced glucagon secretion in both types of experimental diabetes?",
    "input": "The hyperglucagonemia that occurs in vivo in animals made diabetic with alloxan or streptozotocin is not suppressed by high glucose but is suppressed by exogenous insulin. These observations together with other studies suggested that insulin-dependent glucose transport and metabolism by the alpha-cells serves as the primary mechanism controlling glucagon secretion. This hypothesis was tested in the present investigation. The possible interactions between glucose, insulin, and a mixture of 20 amino acids at physiological proportions were examined in the isolated-perfusin diabetic rats. Release of insulin and glucagon were used as indicators of theta-cell and alpha-cell function. According to rigid criteria the diabetic animals entering the study were severely diabetic. It was found that in vitro: (a) basal glucagon release (measured in the absence of an alpha-cell stimulus or inhibitor) was extremely low, even lower (i.e. 10%) than the basal rates seen in controls; (b) the alpha-cells of alloxanized- and streptozotocin-treated rats responded with a biphasic glucagon release to stimulation by an amino acid mixture; (c) this alpha-cell response was reduced after both streptozotocin and alloxan; (d) glucose at 5 mM was a potent inhibitor of amino acid-induced glucagon secretion in both types of experimental diabetes; (e) in alloxan diabetes alpha-cell stimulation by amino acids can be curbed by exogenous insulin, whereas glucagon secretion by the perfused pancreas of streptoxotocin diabetic rats appeared to be resistant to insulin action. The data indicate that the modulation of glucagon secretion by glucose in vitro is indipendent of insulin and that other unknown factors extrinsic to the pancreatic islets are responsible for the hyperglucagonemia observed in vivo.",
    "output": "In the context provided, it is stated that glucose at 5 mM had a potent inhibitory effect on amino acid-induced glucagon secretion in both types of experimental diabetes (alloxan and streptozotocin). This inhibition occurred independently of insulin, suggesting that other unknown factors extrinsic to the pancreatic islets may be responsible for the hyperglucagonemia observed in vivo."

    "input": "Male Wistar rats were treated with an i.v. dose of 100 mg/kg of Streptozotocin (STZ). Either 5 days or 1, 2 or 3 months after induction of diabetes, the adrenal function of these animals was studied. Short course diabetes (5 days) was accompanied by adrenal hypertrophy and high plasma corticosterone levels; during later periods the diabetic rats consistenly showed signs of adrenal hyperactivity, yet both adrenal weight and plasma corticosterone tended to be lower than in the 5 day-treated animals. Adrenal incubations with 14C-progesterone showed that 5 days and one month diabetic animals synthesized more deoxycorticosterone than controls; production of corticosterone and 18-hydroxydeoxycorticosterone was normal at all time periods studied. Synthesis of 18-hydroxycorticosterone, a compound which affects sodium metabolism, was increased in 5 day-treated rats; thereafter, the function of the zona glomerulosa seemed to be impaired in diabetic rats. These results suggest that early after induction of diabetes there is adrenal hyperfunction of the mixed type (i.e. gluco and mineralcorticoid), and that in the later periods (2-3 months), the deranged metabolism of the diabetic rat acts as a chronic stress.",

    "instruction": "What happened to glucose output when insulin alone was infused, thereby creating a selective glucagon deficiency?",
    "input": "The regulation of hepatic glucose production by glucagon and insulin has been studied in the intact dog. An attempt has been made to evaluate the role of basal physiological concentrations of the hormones in the regulation of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Somatostatin was infused continuously into postabsorptive dogs to inhibit the secretion of both glucagon and insulin. Either or both hormones were then replaced intraportally by continuous infusion as desired. The main observations were as follows. (1) When both hormones were simultaneously replaced for periods up to 4.5h, plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations, total glucose output (glycogenolysis plus gluconeogenesis), glucose utilization and the plasma glucose concentration closely matched the same parameters in 0.9% NaCl-infused controls. (2) When glucagon alone was infused, thereby creating a selective insulin deficiency, glucose output (primarily glycogenolysis) rapidly increased by as much as threefold. Glycogenolytic glucose production then fell off progressively and returned to the control value within 4h. The gluconeogenic conversion of [14C]alanine and [14C]lactate into [14C]glucose was stimulated markedly and increased progressively throughout the test period. Glucagon therefore converted the liver from an organ largely dependent on glycogenolysis for glucose production to one heavily dependent on gluconeogenesis. The potent inhibitory effect of basal insulin on postabsorptive glucose output was also clearly apparent. (3) When insulin alone was infused, thereby creating a selective glucagon deficiency, glucose output (glycogenolysis) fell abruptly by about 30% and remained decreased. Gluconeogenesis also decreased (20%) after the selective removal of both insulin and glucagon, but it only remained suppressed for 1h. The low glucose output led to a modest fall in the blood glucose concentration. Thus glucagon plays an important role in maintaining basal glucose production. (4) When insulin was infused and the plasma glucose was kept at its control concentration by infusion of glucose in similar experiments to the above, the hepatic output of glucose fell by as much as 75%. This demonstrates the presence of a glucagon-independent metabolic reflex triggered by a low plasma glucose concentration, the purpose of which is to maintain glucose output at a rate capable of preventing castastrophic hypoglycaemia.",
    "output": "When insulin alone was infused, thereby creating a selective glucagon deficiency, glucose output (glycogenolysis) fell abruptly by about 30% and remained decreased. This suggests that basal glucagon plays an important role in maintaining basal glucose production, and its absence leads to a decrease in glucose output. However, it's important to note that gluconeogenesis also decreased (20%) after the selective removal of both insulin and glucagon, but it only remained suppressed for 1 hour. This indicates that while glucagon is crucial for basal glucose production, other factors, such as gluconeogenesis, can partially compensate for its absence in the short term."

    "instruction": "What happened to the activities of glycogenolytic enzymes in diabetic animals compared to control animals?",
    "input": "The effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes and of insulin supplementation to diabetic rats on glycogen-metabolizing enzymes in liver were determined. The results were compared with those from control animals. The activities of glycogenolytic enzymes, i.e. phosphorylase (both a and b), phosphorylase kinase and protein kinase (in the presence or in the absence of cyclic AMP), were significantly decreased in the diabetic animals. The enzyme activities were restored to control values by insulin therapy. Glycogen synthase (I-form) activity, similarly decreased in the diabetic animals, was also restored to control values after the administration of insulin. The increase in glycogen synthase(I-form) activity after insulin treatment was associated with a concomitant increase in phosphoprotein phosphatase activity. The increase in phosphatase activity was due to (i) a change in the activity of the enzyme itself and (ii) a decrease in a heat stable protein inhibitor of the phosphatase activity.",
    "output": "In diabetic animals, the activities of glycogenolytic enzymes, such as phosphorylase (a and b), phosphorylase kinase, and protein kinase (with or without cyclic AMP), are significantly decreased compared to control animals. This decrease in enzyme activities is due to both a reduction in the enzyme's activity itself and an increase in a heat-stable protein inhibitor of the phosphatase activity. However, the administration of insulin restores these enzyme activities to levels comparable to those in control animals. This restoration is linked to an increase in glycogen synthase (I-form) activity and phosphoprotein phosphatase activity, which is primarily due to changes in the activity of the enzyme itself and a decrease in the heat-stable protein inhibitor of the phosphatase activity."

    "instruction": "What percentage increase in specific binding of (125)I-glucagon was observed in liver plasma membranes from the untreated diabetic rats?",
    "input": "To investigate the role of hepatic glucagon receptors in the hypersensitivity to glucagon observed in insulin-deprived diabetics, liver plasma membranes were prepared from control rats and from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats some of whom were treated with high-dose and low-dose insulin. The untreated diabetic animals exhibited hyperglycemia, weight loss, hypoinsulinemia, and hyperglucagonemia. High-dose insulin treatment (2 U Protamine-zinc-insulin/100 g per day) resulted in normoglycemia, normal weight gain, mild hyperinsulinemia, and return of glucagon levels toward base line. The low-dose (1 U protamine-zinc-insulin/100 g per day) insulin-treated diabetic group demonstrated chemical changes intermediate between the untreated and the high-dose insulin-treated animals. In liver plasma membranes from the untreated diabetic rats, specific binding of (125)I-glucagon was increased by 95%. Analysis of binding data suggested that the changes in glucagon binding were a consequence of alterations in binding capacity rather than changes in binding affinity. Furthermore, in the untreated diabetic rats, both basal and glucagon (2 muM)-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity were twofold higher than in controls. In the high-dose insulin-treated diabetic rats, glucagon binding and basal and glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity were normalized to control values, whereas low-dose insulin treatment resulted in changes intermediate between control and untreated diabetic rats. In contrast to glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was similar in all groups of rats. Liver plasma membranes from untreated and insulin-treated diabetic animals degraded (125)I-glucagon to the same extent as control rats. The specific binding of (125)I-insulin in the untreated diabetic animals was 40% higher than in control rats. In low-dose insulin-treated diabetic rats, insulin binding was not significantly different from that of control rats, whereas in the high-dose insulin-treated group in whom plasma insulin was 70% above control levels, insulin binding was 30% lower than in control rats. These findings suggest that alterations in glucagon receptors may contribute to the augmented glycemic and ketonemic response to glucagon observed in insulin-deprived diabetics.",

    "input": "The major objectives of this study were to define the roles of adrenal glucocorticoids and glucagon in the long-term regulation of fatty acid synthetase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase of mammalian adipose tissue and liver. Particular emphasis was given to elucidation of the mechanisms whereby these hormones produce their regulatory effects on enzymatic activity. To dissociate mental manipulation, nutritional conditions were ridgidly controlled in the experiments described. Administration of glucocorticoids to adult rats led to a marked reductionin activities of fatty acid synthetase and carboxylase in adipose in adipose tissue but no change occurred in liver. Adrenalectomy produced an increase in activities of these lipogenic enzymes in adipose tissure, but, again, no change was noted in liver. The decrease in enzymatic activities in adipose tissue with glucocorticoid administration correlated well with a decrease in fatty acid synthesis, determined in vivo by the 3-H2O method. The mechanisms whereby glucocorticoids led to a decrease in fatty acid synthetase activity were elucidated by the use of immunochemical techniques. Thus, the decrease in fatty acid synthetase activity observed in adipose tissue was shown to reflect a decrease in content of enzyme, and not a change in catalytic efficiency. The mechanism underlying the decrease in enzyme content is a decrease in synthesis of the enzyme. The relation of the effects of glucocorticoids to the effects of certain other hormones involved in regulation of lipogenesis was investigated in hypophysectomized and in diabetic animals. Thus, the observation that the glucocorticoid effect on synthetase and carboxylase occurred in adipose tissue of hypophysectomized rats indicated that alterations in levels of other pituitary-regulated hormones were not necessary for the effect. That glucocorticoids play some role in regulation of synthetase and carboxylase in liver, at lease in the diabetic state, was shown by the observation that the low activities of these enzymes in diabetic animals could be restored to normal by adrenalectomy. An even more pronounced restorative effect was apparent in adipose tissue of adrenalectomized, diabetic animals. Administration of glucagon during the refeeding of starved rats resulted in a marked reduction in the induction of fatty acid synthetase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and in the rate of incorporation of 3-H from 3-H2O into fatty acids in liver, but no change in these parameters occurred in adipose tissue. Administration of theophylline resulted in intermediate reduction in liver. The mechanisms whereby glucagon led tto a decrease in fatty acid synthetase activity were elucidated by the use of immunochemical techniques. Thus, the changes in fatty acid synthetase activity were shown to reflect reductions in content of enzyme. The mechanism underlying these reductions in content is reduced synthesis of enzyme.",
    "output": "The administration of glucocorticoids to adult rats resulted in a decrease in the activities of fatty acid synthetase and carboxylase in adipose tissue but not in the liver. This decrease in enzymatic activities in adipose tissue is due to a decrease in the synthesis of these enzymes. In contrast, glucocorticoids appear to play some role in regulating the activities of these enzymes in the liver, particularly in the diabetic state, as adrenalectomy can restore the low activities of these enzymes in diabetic animals. Glucagon, on the other hand, leads to a decrease in the activities of fatty acid synthetase and carboxylase in the liver, but not in adipose tissue, by reducing the synthesis of these enzymes."

    "instruction": "What was the dose of Streptozotocin used to make the rats diabetic?",
    "input": "The factors that control adrenal steroid secretion and metabolism were investigated in rats made diabetic with Streptozotocin (65 mg/kg) and used one month after treatment. Diabetic animals possessed high resting levels of plasma corticosterone accompanied by adrenal hypertrophy; the showed an increased response to the stress of i.p. cold water injection. Moreover, the pituitaries of diabetic rats seemed to be releasing ACTH continuously and not storing it. Upon adrenal inhibition with Aminoglutethimide the expected increase in adrenal cholesterol and weight was of a smaller magnitude than in controls. The activity of liver enzymes that reduce ring A of corticosterone showed decreased activity in diabetics, which suggests that more corticosterone rather than its inactive metabolites were available to--but not able to suppress--the steroid feedback sites. The half-life of corticosterone in blood was similar in diabetes and controls. These results suggest that (a) diabetic animals were in a chronic stress condition; (b) the threshold for steroid feedback was less sensitive to variations in plasma corticosterone; (c) there is an abnormal peripheral disposal of corticosterone, but that other factors, besides the liver, regulate the clearance of the hormone from the circulation in the diabetic animals.",

    "instruction": "How long did it take for insulin to fully activate synthase phosphatase activity in diabetic animals?",
    "input": "Insulin rapidly produced an increase in per cent of total heart glycogen synthase in the I form in fed rats. In fasted rats the response was diminished and delayed. In diabetic animals there was no response over the 15-min time period studied. Since synthase phosphatase activity is necessary for synthase D to I conversion, the phosphatase activity was determined in extracts from these groups of animals. In the fasted and diabetic rats phosphatase activity was less than one-half of that in fed animals. Administration of insulin to fasting animals increased synthase phosphatase activity to a level approaching that of fed animals by 15 min. In diabetic animals insulin also stimulated an increase in synthase phosphatase activity but 30 min were required for full activation. Insulin had no effect in normal fed animals. Insulin activation of synthase phosphatase activity in heart extracts from fasted animals was still present after Sephadex G-25 chromatography and ammonium sulfate precipitation. Thus insulin had induced a stable modification of the phosphatase itself or of its substrate synthase D rendering the latter a more favorable substrate for the reaction. A difference in sensitivity of the reaction to glycogen inhibition was present between fed and fasted animals. Increasing concentrations of glycogen had only a slight inhibitory effect in extracts from fed animals but considerably reduced activity in extracts from fasted animals. Insulin administration reduced the sensitivity of the phosphatase reaction to glycogen inhibition. This could explain, at least in part, the increased phosphatase activity noted in the insulin-treated, fasted rats since glycogen was routinely added to the homogenizing buffer.",

    "instruction": "What was the effect of adding insulin to diabetic rat lung slices in vitro on the depressed glucose oxidative rate during a 2 h incubation period?",
    "input": "Adult rats were rendered diabetic by a single iv injection of streptozotocin (70 or 75 mg/kg). In these rats, serum insulin fell to minimal levels during the 48 h following drug treatment, and this was roughly paralleled by a progressive decrease in the ability of the lung to oxidize glucose. The addition of insulin to diabetic rat lung slices in vitro had no restorative effect on the depressed glucose oxidative rate during a 2 h incubation period; however, two daily treatments of the rats with 1 unit of protamine, zinc insulin completely restored lung glucose oxidation rate to normal, without significantly reducing the hyperglycemic state of the rats. An examination of the temporal changes in glucose utilization by the rat lung after acute insulin treatment revealed that the diabetic lung responded directly to serum levels of insulin, whereas the normal lung appeared to be unaffected by serum insulin levels as hihg as 87 ng/ml. The reduced rate of glucose oxidation in the diabetic lung was apparent after perfusion of the lung with glucose-free medium, and was characterized by a significant reduction in Vmax without an alteration in Km. This was attended by a depressed ability of the lung to incorporate [3H]leucine into protein and an increased ability to produce lactate, but hexose monophosphate shunt activity was normal. Specific receptors for insulin have been identified and partially characterized in crude membrane preparations of normal rat lung. The interaction of insulin with these receptors was rapid, reversible, saturable, and was dependent upon time and temperature. The binding of labeled insulin was inhibited by low concentrations of unlabeled insulin and by high concentrations of  proinsulin, whereas it was unaffected by the presence of glucagon, gastrin, prolactin, ACTH, or growth hormone in microgram amounts.  These observations suggest that insulin regulates the transport and utilization of glucose in the rat lung, and that this tissue contains specific receptors for insulin.",
    "output": "The addition of insulin to diabetic rat lung slices in vitro did not have a restorative effect on the depressed glucose oxidative rate during a 2 h incubation period. However, two daily treatments of the rats with 1 unit of protamine, zinc insulin restored lung glucose oxidation rate to normal without significantly reducing the hyperglycemic state of the rats. This suggests that insulin regulates the transport and utilization of glucose in the rat lung, but the insulin added in vitro may not have been able to effectively perform this function. The reduced rate of glucose oxidation in the diabetic lung was characterized by a significant reduction in Vmax without an alteration in Km, accompanied by a depressed ability of the lung to incorporate [3H]leucine into protein and an increased ability to produce lactate. This implies that insulin plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism in the rat lung, and that the diabetic state impairs this process."

The diagnosis depends essentially on the finding of an epithelial border which is difficult to demonstrate for it is often interrupted on one part of the circumference. Malignancy is suggested by the characteristics of the cells and the structural disorganisation. Total removal is necessary to avoid relapses, provided one removes neighbouring organs and all invaded lymph nodes. Cystadenomas and cystadeno-carcinomas are very rare tumours.

The origin of the phyllod tumour is not clear and the authors discuss the possibility of its development upon a preexistent tumour, specifically on a fibroadenoma of the breast. The treatment is guided by the microscopic appearances. Generally they perform the ablation of the tumour when its dimensions are not greater then 10 cm. and the simple mastectomy when its diameter exceeds this dimension.",
    "output": "For a phyllodes tumour with a diameter greater than 10 cm, the typical treatment is a simple mastectomy. This is because when the tumour exceeds a diameter of 10 cm, there's a higher risk of local recurrence, and a simple mastectomy provides a more comprehensive removal of the tumour. However, the exact treatment plan can vary depending on the individual case and the specific characteristics of the tumour, so it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice."

These tumors, thought to be of neural origin, are difficult to diagnose preoperatively. The diagnosis should be considered in adult females presenting with an intramural mass of the proximal or distal third of the esophagus. Symptoms of dysphagia and substernal discomfort are likely to occur with lesions greater than one centimeter in diameter. Preoperative biopsy is not advised as a mistaken diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma can result.",
    "output": "Symptoms likely to occur with granular cell tumors of the esophagus that are greater than one centimeter in diameter include dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and substernal discomfort (pain or discomfort behind the sternum). These symptoms are more pronounced with larger tumors. However, it's important to note that these symptoms can be non-specific and may also be associated with other conditions, which is why a definitive diagnosis is best made through surgical excision. Preoperative biopsy is not typically advised due to the risk of misdiagnosis, particularly as squamous cell carcinoma."

Secondary colonic involvement in patients with advanced lymphoma is not uncommon and is frequently undetected. The radiographic findings of 34 patients with colonic lymphoma were reviewed. Thirteen patients had primary tumors, while the remaining 21 had colonic involvement secondary to systemic disease. The radiologic features were classified as mucosal nodularity, endo-exoenteric mass, intraluminal mass, mural infiltration, and mesenteric invasion. One patient with diffuse mucosal nodularity developed acute colonic dilatation, while two other patients had pneumatosis coli secondary to local tumor depositions. Lymphoma is now a well-described complication of chronic ulcerative colitis, and a further case is described here. Although colonic lymphoma is a relatively rare tumor, the spectrum of radiologic changes reviewed here may enable a more accurate radiologic diagnosis.",

The populations of HA1 polypeptides were immunogenic but considerably less so than the intact HA molecule and induced antibody which cross-reacted with influenza A and B viruses. After absorption with heterologous influenza B virus, the cross-reacting antibodies were removed and the HA1 antisera then possessed antibodies which reacted only with the cross-reactive (CR) determinants of the HA of the homologous influenza A virus and viruses of the same subtype. Neither strain-specific (SS) nor virus-neutralizing antibodies were detected in these anti-HA1 sera. HA2 polypeptides were less immunogenic and anti-HA2 antisera after absorption with influenza B virus failed to react with influenza A virus in immuno double diffusion tests and only reacted with partially denatured HA in the more sensitive single radial diffusion tests.",

The experiments showed that while in the viruses isolated in 1968--1972 the H3 antigen was dominating, in the A/Port Chalmers/1/73 virus and some viruses isolated in 1975--1976 this antigen became more and more minor. A correlation was observed between the content of H3 antigen in viruses and the capacity of anti-H3 antiserum to inhibit the infectious activity of viruses. The prepared monospecific serum to H3 antigen contained no antibody to the other two antigenic determinants of virus or to neuraminidase and host cell antigen and was completely free from inhibitors. The serum could be used in HI, CFT, and immunodiffusion tests for the analysis of the antigenic composition of newly isolated influenza viruses.",

The immune cells were raised during infection with homologous or heterologous A strain influenza viruses or with a type B virus. The greatest antiviral effect, measured by reduction in lung virus level of recipient mice, occurred if homologous viruses were used. Sharing of haemagglutinin specificity was shown to be important, but significant antiviral activity was still expressed if neither haemagglutinin nor neuraminidase antigenic specificities were shared. The antiviral effect was type-specific. Adoptive transfer of type A influenza immune T cells did not express antiviral activity against type B virus, and vice versa. On the basis of earlier work, the effector population in the transferred cells was cytotoxic T cells (Tc). Intranasal reinfection of mice with a heterologous type A virus sharing neither haemagglutinin nor neuraminidase antigenic specificity with the first infecting virus induced enhanced and earlier production of cross-reactive Tc against type A influenza viruses. This was paralleled by significantly lower virus levels in the lungs. The results of this work demonstrate heterotypic cell-mediated immunity in influenza virus infection in mice.",

Surface antigens of infected, unfixed primary monkey kidney cells were stained in suspension by an indirect immunofluorescence technique with anti-H3N2 and anti-H1N1 antisera. In tests of cells infected with known viruses, the members of the H3N2 family could not be distinguished from one another, but were easily distinguished from H1N1 strains. A total of 101 hemadsorption-positive clinical specimens were evaluated over a 6-month period. Forty-five of 48 influenza A H3N2 and 24 of 29 H1N1 specimens confirmed by hemagglutination inhibition were correctly identified by membrane fluorescence of cultured cells, with no misidentifications among influenza strains and with 1 false positive among 24 non-influenza isolates.

    "input": "A study is described of influenza A anti-neuraminidase antibodies in the sera of young people of three different groups. Each serum was individually absorbed with viruses containing the N2 neuraminidases of 1957, 1968 and 1972. Rabbit antisera prepared against the viruses were similarly absorbed. Results obtained with the animal sera suggested that these neuraminidases were antigenically distinct, but the human sera had a broader range of anti-neuraminidase activity and gave indication of asymmetric antigenic relationships. Earlier workers who surveyed anti-haemagglutinin antibodies reported that the virus of primary infection absorbed all antibodies, and the virus of secondary infection only those directed against itself. We too found that the virus of secondary infection absorbed only homologous anti-neuraminidase antibody. However, although the primary infecting virus did absorb some secondary antibody, this absorption was incomplete and it lessened with the lengthening of the time interval between the primary and secondary infecting viruses. A similar pattern was seen with anti-haemagglutinin antibodies. Absorption of anti-neuraminidase antibodies from human sera proved much more difficult than absorption of anti-haemagglutinin antibodies particularly after repeated influenza virus infections. The relative rarity of antigenic shift in the neuraminidase subunit also creates problems in the interpretation of results of serum neuraminidase antibody surveys.",
    "output": "As the time interval between the primary and secondary infecting viruses lengthened, the absorption of secondary anti-neuraminidase antibody by the primary infecting virus was found to be incomplete and lessened. This means that as more time passed between the two infections, the primary virus absorbed less and less of the secondary antibody, suggesting a weakening of the immune response over time. This phenomenon was not observed with anti-haemagglutinin antibodies to the same extent."

    "instruction": "What is the effect of treatment with anti-thymocyte serum on the induction and expression of heterotypic resistance in mice?",
    "input": "Infection of mice with subtype A0 OR A2 human influenza viruses, by a non-respiratory route causing no lethality, renders the animals markedly resistant to subsequent respiratory challenge with a strain differing from the first one through its haemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens. This state of heterotypic immunity which appears rapidly (5 days) after the first infection, manifests itself during the second infection by a much reduced mortality, by less extensive lung lesions than in the control mice and by a final drop in lung virus titre (while in controls this titre stays at a high level until death) associated with a rapid rise of serum antibody levels against the haemagglutinin of the challenge virus and the \"soluble\" antigen common to type A strains. The development of this state of heterotypic immunity is dependent on the capacity of the first virus inoculated to replicate actively in the mouse. The role played by cell-mediated immunity in this phenomenon is evidenced by the fact that both the induction and the expression of this state of heterotypic resistance may be abolished by treatment of the mice with anti-thymocyte serum, while they are not affected by cyclophosphamide. Furthermore, in the mouse infected with an influenza A0 or A2 virus, it has been possible to demonstrate completely cross-reactive delayed type hypersensitivity reactions against the virions or their products. The fact that heterotypic immunity is not demonstrable between influenza viruses of type A and B favors the hypothesis that an antigen (matrix or nucleoprotein) common to all A subtypes--but different in B type strains--plays a role in these reactions of cross-protection.",
    "output": "Treatment with anti-thymocyte serum has a significant effect on the induction and expression of heterotypic resistance in mice infected with human influenza viruses. Specifically, it abolishes the development of this state of heterotypic immunity, which is characterized by reduced mortality, less extensive lung lesions, and a drop in lung virus titers during subsequent respiratory challenges with a strain different from the first one. This effect is likely due to the role of cell-mediated immunity in the phenomenon, as it is not affected by cyclophosphamide. The absence of heterotypic immunity between influenza viruses of type A and B suggests that an antigen common to all A subtypes, but different in B type strains, may play a role in these reactions of cross-protection."

Responses to closely related influenza A virus strains of the H3N2 subtype cross-reacted but could also be differentiated.

    "input": "Studies were carried out to define the mechanism of action of growth hormone on adrenocortical steroidogenesis in hypophysectomized female rats. ACTH administration for 7 days increased corticosterone secretion in vivo and corticosterone production by adrenal tissue in vitro. Adrenal mitochondrial and microsomal cytochrome P-450 concentrations as well as the activities of cytochrome P-450-dependent enzymes (cholesterol sidechain cleavage, 11beta-hydroxylase, 21-hydroxylase) were also increased by ACTH. Administration of bovine growth hormone alone to hypophysectomized rats had no effect on any of the parameters evaluated. However, when given in combination with ACTH, growth hormone synergistically enhanced the effects of ACTH on cholesterol sidechain cleavage activity and corticosterone secretion. The magnitude of the pregnenolone-induced difference spectrum in adrenal mitochondria, indicative of cholesterol binding to cytochrome P-450, was also increased by growth hormone, but neither cytochrome P-450 content nor the activities of other steroidogenic enzymes were affected. The results indicate that growth hormone interacts with ACTH to promote corticosterone secretion by increasing the association of cholesterol with adrenal mitochondrial cytochrome P-450, thereby increasing the activity of cholesterol sidechain cleavage, the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis.",

The effects of stress, adrenalectomy and corticosterone treatment on the functional activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical system have been studied using highly sensitive and precise bio-assay methods for the determination of ACTH and CRH.2. Adrenalectomy resulted in a rise and corticosterone treatment a fall in the hypothalamic CRH content and the plasma ACTH concentration.3. Stress caused a fall followed by a rise in the hypothalamic CRH content, a rise in the pituitary and plasma ACTH concentrations and an increase in the plasma corticosterone concentration.4. The stress-induced changes in hypothalamic CRH content and pituitary and plasma ACTH were exaggerated in adrenalectomized rats but normal in adrenalectomized rats treated with corticosterone. They were also normal in animals injected I.P. with corticosterone 15 min before the stress but inhibited in those similarly treated 60 min previously.5. The ability of adenohypophyses and hypothalami to synthesize and release in vitro ACTH and CRH respectively in response to trophic stimuli was exaggerated in glands removed from adrenalectomized rats and reduced in those removed from corticosterone-treated rats.6. Addition of corticosterone to the pre-incubation medium reduced the capacities of adenohypophyses and hypothalami removed from untreated rats to synthesize and release ACTH and CRH respectively.",

Corticosterone treatment, on the other hand, results in a fall in both the hypothalamic CRH content and plasma ACTH concentration.

    "input": "Groups of female rats were injected daily for 14 days with 10 mg of cortisone acetate subcutaneously, to study the mechanisms of glucocorticoid suppression on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) content, plasma ACTH, adrenal venous corticosterone, adrenal weights, and the catabolic effects on body weight were studied simultaneously (under stressful and non-stressful conditions) before, during, and up to six weeks after cortisone. This study confirmed the results of other investigators that cortisone acetate caused catabolic weight loss and adrenal atrophy, but it was noted to persist up to six weeks after the injections. Glucocorticoid acetate was more effective in causing ACTH-axis suppression than succinate or phosphate preparations, and the effects were dose and time related. Significant depletion of pituitary ACTH content, suppression of plasma ACTH, and corticosterone secretion occurred five to seven days after beginning cortisone acetate (p=<0.001); it was continuous throughout the injection schedule (p=<0.001); it remained for two to four weeks after the cortisone was discontinued (p=<0.001). The animals showed minimum plasma ACTH responsiveness to severe acute stress during this two to four-week suppression phase, but rapid recovery occurred thereafter. Plasma ACTH was undetectable up to six weeks post-cortisone when the animals were not under stress. This may be related to residual cortisone acetate found at the injection sites, or to an altered or different ACTH-axis control mechanism. The sequence of events during recovery from cortisone suppression appeared to be (1) repletion of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (by inference), (2) repletion of pituitary ACTH content, (3) secretion of plasma ACTH, (4) reversal of adrenal atrophy, and (5) subsequent secretion of corticosterone.",

    "input": "The plasma cortisol response to hypoglycemia is widely used as a test of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function. It was the aim of this study to determine whether this test gives a reliable indication of pituitary corticotropin (ACTH) release in patients recovering from adrenocortical suppression due to corticosteroid or ACTH therapy. The 16 patients who were studied (6 on more than one occasion) had received in excess of 5 mg predinisone or equivalent daily for over 12 months. The insulin tolerance tests were carried out 18 h after stopping steroid therapy. The tests were then repeated three to four days after adrenal function had been restored (as indicated by urinary oxogenic steroid excretion of greater than 35 mg/24 h) by zinc tetracosactrin administration. The ACTH response to hypoglycemia was significantly impaired in the steroid-treated group. However with the exception of one patient who had persistently elevated resting ACTH levels there was a significant correlation (P less than 0.01) between the maximum increments in plasma cortisol and ACTH during hypoglycemia. No significant difference in sensitivity to endogenous ACTH could be demonstrated between the steroid-treated group and 12 normal control subjects. Following ACTH administration the plasma ACTH and growth hormone responses to hypoglycemia were significantly reduced, but the response in plasma cortisol was not significantly affected. It is concluded that the plasma cortisol response to hypoglycemia gives a useful indication of ACTH release in steroid-treated patients provided that they have not recently received exogenous ACTH.",

    "instruction": "What is the duration for which the adrenal cortex remains in a hyperresponsive state after slow intravenous administration of ACTH?",
    "input": "Modifications of adrenocortical steroidogenic response to ACTH as a consequence of acute prior exposure to this hormone, were studied in 106 normal subjects divided in 15 experimental groups. Adrenocortical response was assessed by the changes in plasma cortisol level and in urinary excretion of cortisol, 17-ketogenic and 17-ketosteroids; in some experiments plasma 11-deoxycortisol, corticosterone, progesterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone were determined as well, together with urinary excretion of the unconjugated form of 11-deoxycortisol and corticosterone. Slow (8-h) intravenous administration of ACTH in amounts producing maximal response, leaves the adrenal cortex in a hyperresponsive state in case of further stimulation for up to 3 days, while the adrenocortical secretion comes back to baseline in the meantime. This potentiation phenomenon seems to concern essentially cortisol secretion since, among the compounds measured only cortisol and 11-deoxycortisol secretions increased progressively in amplitude when ACTH was administered repeatedly. Futhermore the degree of ACTH-induced adrenocortical hyperresponsiveness was found to depend on the amount of ACTH injected and on the time during which the adrenal cells are exposed to high peptide hormone concentrations. Increased adrenocortical responsiveness to ACTH persists when endogenous corticotropin secretion was suppressed for a few days by dexamethasone in normal subjects. Thus the potentiation phenomenon is not critically dependent on continued exposure of adrenal cells to endogenous corticotropin.",
    "output": "The adrenal cortex remains in a hyperresponsive state after slow intravenous administration of ACTH for up to 3 days, according to the provided context. This hyperresponsiveness is most notably observed in cortisol secretion, as other measured compounds do not show similar progressive increases. The degree of hyperresponsiveness is influenced by the amount of ACTH injected and the duration of high peptide hormone concentrations in the adrenal cells. This potentiation phenomenon is not critically dependent on continued exposure to endogenous corticotropin."

    "input": "Adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) and corticosterone in the plasma of adult female rats were measured sequentially at 4 h intervals for 24 h before and after lesions of the suprachiasmatic nuclei or treatment with p-chlorophenylalanine (to inhibit serotonin synthesis). After lesions or p-chlorophenylalanine treatment, the concentrations of ACTH were diminished relative to those in control animals and rhythmic changes could not be detected. However, injection of animals, pretreated with p-chlorophenylalanine, with 5-hydroxytryptophan (60 mg/kg) 8 h before the time when plasma ACTH is maximal in intact animals, stimulated ACTH secretion up to control values. Mean corticosterone concentrations in plasma remained unchanged (after lesions) or increased (after p-chlorophenylalanine). This increase was associated with an increased minimal concentration of corticosterone. After both treatments there was evidence of continued circadian or ultradian rhythms of corticosterone concentration. Locomotor activity of female rats given identical treatment, but without blood sampling, indicated that nocturnal activity was diminished after lesions whereas diurnal activity was enhanced after p-chlorophenylalanine treatment. Periodicity analysis detected the persistence of free-running circadian, and sometimes ultradian activity, rhythms. Adrenalectomy did not alter further the activity pattern observed in rats with lesions. These results therefore support the proposition that both the suprachiasmatic nuclei and the serotoninergic system play an irreplaceable role in the mechanism of ACTH secretory rhythms. The suprachiasmatic nuclei are also important for synchronization of locomotor activity and corticosterone rhythms, which may both persist after the suppression of ACTH rhythms.",
    "output": "After lesions of the suprachiasmatic nuclei or treatment with p-chlorophenylalanine, the concentrations of ACTH in adult female rats were diminished, and rhythmic changes could not be detected. However, when animals pretreated with p-chlorophenylalanine were injected with 5-hydroxytryptophan, ACTH secretion was stimulated up to control values. Meanwhile, corticosterone concentrations remained unchanged or increased, with an increased minimal concentration of corticosterone observed. Despite the suppression of ACTH rhythms, evidence of continued circadian or ultradian rhythms of corticosterone concentration was found. Locomotor activity of female rats was also affected, with nocturnal activity diminished after lesions and diurnal activity enhanced after p-chlorophenylalanine treatment. The results suggest that both the suprachiasmatic nuclei and the serotoninergic system play an essential role in the mechanism of ACTH secretory rhythms and the synchronization of locomotor activity and corticosterone rhythms."

    "instruction": "What was the duration of the constant ACTH infusion during which plasma cortisol continued to increase?",
    "input": "The dynamic response of the adrenal cortex to ACTH infusion is analyzed by simulating the distribution, binding, and metabolism of cortisol and aldosterone in a multicompartmental model. The model includes the effects of temperature and cortisol concentration on aldosterone binding in plasma and the distribution between plasma and red blood cells, as verified by new observations. The secretion rates of cortisol and aldosterone were computed from serial measurements of plasma concentrations of endogenous steroids and infused tracers. The model was validated by observations after iv injection of a bolus of cortisol. Nineteen normal volunteers were studied on the fourth day on a diet containing 10 meq sodium. Endogenous ACTH was suppressed by dexamethasone, and alpha-1-24ACTH was infused at two different rates in various sequences over a 4-h period. During each hour of constant ACTH infusion, plasma cortisol continued to increase, while plasma aldosterone rose quickly, reaching a plateau within 20--30 min. Cortisol secretion approached a maximim rate after 20--30 min of ACTH infusion; the continued increase of plasma cortisol resulted from the slow equilibrium with other compartments. Aldosterone secretion rose quickly to a peak and then declined to a lower level after 20 min of ACTH infusion; the lower rate of secretion was maintained for the duration of the constant infusion of ACTH, falling abruptly within a few minutes after stopping the infusion. The characteristic differences in plasma steroid responses to various sequences of ACTH infusions can be explained by the more rapid changes in aldosterone secretion and the different clearance rates of cortisol and aldosterone, which vary with plasma cortisol concentration. The temperature at which blood is separated significantly affects plasma aldosterone measurements.",
    "output": "The duration of the constant ACTH infusion during which plasma cortisol continued to increase was for the entire hour of the infusion. However, it's important to note that the continued increase of plasma cortisol resulted from the slow equilibrium with other compartments, and not due to a continuous increase in secretion rate. The secretion rate of cortisol approached a maximum rate after 20-30 minutes of ACTH infusion."

    "input": "The pituitary-adrenal axis activity was evaluated in 43 patients, treated for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, by measuring plasma ACTH, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), testosterone, and aldosterone. Dynamic studies were performed by injecting 250 micrograms synthetic ACTH im and collecting blood samples 1 h later for steroid analysis. Twelve to fourteen hours after the last hydrocortisone dose given the evening before, plasma ACTH fluctuated widely from less than 10-475 pg/ml, 17-OHP exceeded normal values and varied from 1-275 ng/ml, while testosterone ranged from 3-151 ng/100 ml. The correlations between ACTH and 17-OHP (n equal 61, r equal 0.665, P less than 0.001) and between 17-OHP and testosterone (n = 43, r = 0.761, P less than 0.001) were good, while that between 17-OHP and aldosterone (n = 64, r = 0.512, P less than 0.001) was rather poor. One hour after ACTH injection, the mean level of 17-OHP was significantly increased as compared to the mean basal level [96.8 ng/ml +/- 10.6 (SE) as compared to 67.0 ng/ml +/- 8.1 (SE)]. However, only 12 out of the 48 tests showed a positive response equal to or greater than 100%, and the majority of these responses (10 out of 12) occurred when basal levels of 17-OHP were between 10-70 ng/ml. This suggests that when basal levels fall outside these values, the pituitary-adrenal axis is either too inhibited or too stimulated to react to exogenous ACTH. Of the 48 tests where 17-OHP was measured, 23 had basal level values within these limits, the mean being 40.3 ng/ml. The corresponding mean ACTH level was 99 pg/ml with a wide range (1-230 pg/ml). On the other hand, in prepubertal children who exhibited 17-OHP concentrations between 10-70 ng/ml, testosterone varied from 3-30 ng/100 ml, with a mean of 16.0 ng/100 ml +/- 1.9 (SE) which is not different from the mean level found in normal children [14.0 ng/100 ml +/- 1.3 (SE)]. Thus, under the influence of endogenous ACTH which is moderately increased, 17-OHP concentrations far exceed normal values, whereas plasma testosterone seems to be unaffected.",

The hormone was infused over a period of 45 min, at which time the plasma ACTH concentration had reached a steady state. A specific and sensitive bioassay, based on the corticosterone production of dispersed adrenal cells, was used to measure the plasma ACTH concentration. With increasing infusion rates of ACTH, a threefold decrease in the MCR of ACTH was observed. Previous studies of our group have shown that the MCR of corticosterone increases as a function of the infusion rate of the steroid. It appears, therefore, that the metabolism of these two hormonal links of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis vary in opposite fashions as a function of the secretion rate of the hormone.",

In contrast to prior reports involving suppression of stress-induced ACTH release, the inhibitory effect of corticosterone was shown, under our experimental conditions, to be exerted also on the basal rate of ACTH secretion. Indeed, a slight though not significant decrease of plasma ACTH concentration was observed with the corticosterone infusion rate of 0.64 mg/min per 100 g body weight, and further progressive and highly significant drops in concentration were recorded for infusion rates of 2.56 and 5.12 mg/min per 100 g body weight. An increase of the metabolic clearance rate of corticosterone, observed as a function of the infusion rate, was ascribed to saturation by the steroid of the plasma transcortin binding sites.",

Mean plasma-glucose (206 +/- 24 mg/dl during conventional insulin treatment) fell to 89 +/- 3 mg/dl at day 7 and 84 +/- 2 mg/dl at day 14 of pump treatment; glycosuria was eliminated. Plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids were elevated during conventional insulin treatment but fell to normal after 7 days of pump treatment. Plasma-levels of branched-chain aminoacids were 50-60% above control levels during conventional treatment but fell to normal after 7 days of pump therapy. Aminoacids were reduced from their high postprandial levels to normal values after insulin-pump treatment. In addition to restoring plasma-glucose to normal, treatment of diabetes with a portable insulin-infusion system results in restoration of normal lipid and aminoacid metabolism.

Furthermore, the rapidity by which hypophosphatemia may be induced following an increment in plasma-free insulin concentration is not well defined. Therefore this study compared the effects of different rates of insulin infusion on the changes in plasma phosphate concentration in ketotic, hyperglycemic diabetic man. Sixteen prospective studies were performed in four insulin-dependent ketotic diabetic subjects. Insulin was infused according to one of four different protocols: high dose (1.0 U/kg/hr), low dose (0.1 U/kg/hr), very low dose (0.01 U/kg/hr) and control (saline only). Plasma phosphate, glucose, and free insulin concentrations were measured sequentially during the 60 min infusion periods. We observed that plasma phosphate concentrations declined significantly only with low-dose and high-dose insulin infusions. The magnitude and rapidity of fall of the mean phosphate concentration were greatest with high-dose insulin infusion.

Glipizide did not produce glucose variations in either test but did result in a significant decrease, in the first test only, in mean plasma baseline levels of lactate, which were higher than normal in these patients. There was no reduction in daily insulin requirements after the period of associated glipizide-insulin treatment. It is concluded that, in the dosage used, intravenous glipizide probably has no hypoglycaemic effects in insulin-dependent diabetics. Moreover, it did not prove useful in combination with insulin. However, the reduction in plasma lactate may be related to an acute enhancement of the exogenously administered insulin. This improvement in the insulin effect may be an acute one among the so called \"extra-pancreatic\" actions which have been demonstrated for glipizide and other sulphonylureas.",

Blood was obtained hourly for determinations of total CO2, plasma glucose, and osmolality, and, in previously untreated patients, plasma insulin. Serum values of beta hydroxybutyrate, electrolytes, and acetone were monitored every two hours. Plasma insulin levels were in the therapeutically effective range with each method of administration. There were no statistically significant differences in rate of correction of ketoacidosis, rate of reduction of plasma glucose, or decline in plasma osmolality. The incidence and the severity of hypokalemia were increased in the patients receiving subcutaneous insulin. There was less variation in the rate of reduction of plasma glucose in the infusion group. Low-dose continuous intravenous infusion of insulin is at least as effective in treating diabetic ketoacidosis as the traditional high-dose intermittent subcutaneous injection of insulin and offers some definite advantages.",

Mean insulin response to oral (100 g) and i.v. glucose load (200 mg/kg followed by 20 mg/kg/min for 60 min) and to arginine infusion (25 g in 30 min) was normal in the prediabetics and delayed and higher in the subjects with chemical diabetes as compared to the control group. Glucagon response to arginine was higher, but not significantly, in prediabetics and in subjects with chemical diabetes. In both of these groups glucagon suppression by glucose was not observed. The insulin/glucagon molar ratio was significantly reduced after glucose infusion in these two groups. No correlation was found between insulin and glucagon secretion after arginine or glucose.

    "input": "Insulin can modulate glucagon-stimulated hepatic glucose production and is considered to be the major factor acting in vivo to exert a couterregulatory action to glucagon. The insulin-dependent diabetic, therefore, might be especially vulnerable to enhanced hepatic glucose production promoted by glucagon. To investigate this hypothesis, low-dose glucagon infusions were administered to normal and diabetic men to compare the effects of glucagon on net splanchnic glucose production (NSGP). Four normal and three insulin-dependent, ketosis-prone, hyperglycemic diabetic men (insulin withheld for 24 hours) underwent brachial-artery-hepatic-vein catheterization. Each received a 90-minute glucagon infusion at 5 ng/kg./min. Glucagon levels rose four-to-fivefold in both groups, plateauing at 300-600 pg./ml. In the normals, NSGP rose from 92+/-12 to 211+/-31 mg./min. at 15 minutes and returned to basal levels by 45 minutes. Insulin measured in the hepatic vein rose from 19+/-6 to 33+/-11 muU/.ml., while plasma glucose rose 17 mg./dl. In the insulin-dependent diabetics, NSGP rose from 78+/-24 to a peak of 221+/-33 mg./min. at 30 minutes and then fell sharply to 113+/-15 mg./min. at 60 minutes despite continuing hyperglucagonemia. Plasma glucose in the diabetics rose 21 mg./dl. These data suggest a mechanism that acts to rapidly diminish glucagon-induced hepatic glucose production in diabetic man but does not appear to be mediated by increased insulin secretion.",

The total insulin dose administered was positively correlated with the level of plasma glucagon and cortisol on admission. During insulin infusion, both glucagon and cortisol fell but the rate of fall was not related to dose or plasma level of free insulin achieved. In six of eight patients studied increments in plasma GH above admission levels were observed during insulin treatment. Admission values of both plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone were raised. The renin levels were highest in newly diagnosed diabetics, and two patients with long-established diabetes showed only small increments despite profound dehydration. Plasma renin activity, but not plasma aldosterone correlated with the fluid and sodium retention over the initial 24 h treatment period, but not with potassium requirements. The urinary excretion rates of the small molecular weight proteins GH and insulin, were considerably elevated over the treatment and convalescent periods.",

    "input": "Sequential determinations of glucose outflow and inflow, and rates of gluconeogenesis from alanine, before, during and after insulin-induced hypoglycemia were obtained in relation to alterations in circulating epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucagon, cortisol, and growth hormone in six normal subjects. Insulin decreased the mean (+/-SEM) plasma glucose from 89+/-3 to 39+/-2 mg/dl 25 min after injection, but this decline ceased despite serum insulin levels of 153+/-22 mul/ml. Before insulin, glucose inflow and outflow were constant averaging 125.3+/-7.1 mg/kg per h. 15 min after insulin, mean glucose outflow increased threefold, but then decreased at 25 min, reaching a rate 15% less than the preinsulin rate. Glucose inflow decreased 80% 15 min after insulin, but increased at 25 min, reaching a maximum of twice the basal rate. Gluconeogenesis from alanine decreased 68% 15 min after insulin, but returned to preinsulin rates at 25 min, and remained constant for the next 25 min, after which it increased linearly. A fourfold increase in mean plasma epinephrine was found 20 min after insulin, with maximal levels 50 times basal. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations first increased significantly at 25 min after insulin, whereas significantly increased levels of cortisol and glucagon occurred at 30 min, and growth hormone at 40 min after insulin. Thus, insulin-induced hypoglycemia in man results from both a decrease in glucose production and an increase in glucose utilization. Accelerated glycogenolysis produced much of the initial, posthypoglycemic increment in glucose production. The contribution of glycogenolysis decreased with time, while that of gluconeogenesis from alanine increased. Of the hormones studied, only the increments in plasma catecholamines preceded or coincided with the measured increase in glucose production after hypoglycemia. It therefore seems probable that adrenergic mechanisms play a major role in the initiation of counter-regulatory responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia in man.",

Prior to the infusion of glucose, insulin administration resulted in stable levels of plasma glucose (76 +/- 8 mg/dl) and glucose output (1.9 +/- 0.1 mg kg-1min-1). The addition of glucose produced a 2-3 fold rise in plasma glucose and a prompt fall in glucose output to 0.2-0.4 mg kg-1min-1, despite the unchanged rate of insulin infusion and the absence of a reduction in plasma glucagon or catecholamines. A similar decline in glucose output was observed when exogenous glucagon (1 ng kg-1-min-1) was added to the glucose infusion. We conclude that in the presence of basal insulin levels hyperglycemia inhibits glucose output independent of a rise in insulin or a fall in anti-insulin hormones.",

The rate of the reaction was pH-dependent in the range of 6.8 to 7.8, increasing as the pH was reduced. Inhibition by superoxide dismutase was enhanced as the EDTA concentration increased and was dependent on enzymatic activity. Under conditions in which superoxide dismutase inhibition was incomplete, catalase inhibited the reaction but mannitol had no effect. The data support the mediation of methemoglobin formation by superoxide. The hypothesis is offered that superoxide anion reduced the heme-bound oxygen in oxygemoglobin by one electron, permitting the subsequent dissociation of ferrihemoglobin and peroxide. The ability of superoxide dismutase to inhibit the formation of methemoglobin may represent one of its functions in the mature erythrocyte.",

Ten to fifty units of superoxide dismutase inhibit fifty to two hundred units of superoxide dismutase stimulate ethylene formation from methionine by chloroplast lamellae in the presence of ferredoxin. This stimulation is stronger at pH 7.0 than at pH 7.8. Catalase inhibits ethylene formation from methionine. 3. Pulse-radiolytic production of nitrite (NO-2) from hydroxylamine, initiated by hydroxyl radicals (.OH) or O-2, shows no difference in the presence or absence of ferredoxin, nor do the decay kinetics of O2. 4. From the above observations and from model reactions (xanthine/xanthine oxidase; iron salts in the presence of H2O2), it is concluded that reduced ferredoxin in the presence of H2O2 forms a Fenton-type oxidizing species for methionine, generating ethylene in the presence of pyridoxal phosphate. 5. Inhibitory effects of both superoxide dismutase and catalase in oxygen-dependent reactions need not necessarily indicate the participation of the 'Haber-Weiss' reaction.",

    "input": "Reaction of bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase with H2O2 was accompanied by a luminescence whose intensity was a function of the concentration of H2O2 and whose duration was coincident with the inactivation of the enzyme by this reagent. Oxygen, which protected against inactivation, also diminished the luminescence. Several other compounds which prevented the inactivation by H2O2 also modified the luminescence. Thus urate, formate, and triethylamine inhibited luminescence whereas imidazole and xanthine augmented it. These seemingly contrary effects can be explained by assuming that the compounds which protected the enzyme were peroxidized in competition with the sensitive group on the enzyme. The luminescence arises because that group on the enzyme was oxidized to a product in an electronically excited state, which could return to the ground state by emitting light. Imidazole and xanthine gave electronically excited products whose quantum efficiency was greater than that of the group on the enzyme, whereas urate, formate, and triethylamine gave products with much lower luminescent efficiencies. This superoxide dismutase could catalyze the peroxidation of a wide range of compounds, including ferrocytochrome c, luminol, diphenylisobenzofuran, dianisidine, and linoleic acid. In control experiments, boiled enzyme was inactive. This peroxidative activity can lead to unexpected effects when superoxide dismutase is added to H2O2-producing systems, as a probe for the involvement of O2-. Several examples from the literature are cited to illustrate the misinterpretations which this previously unrecognized peroxidative activity can generate.",
    "output": "In the presence of oxygen during the reaction of bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase with H2O2, the luminescence was diminished. This is because oxygen protected the enzyme from inactivation by H2O2, but it also competed with the sensitive group on the enzyme for peroxidation. The luminescence arises from the oxidation of a specific group on the enzyme to a product in an electronically excited state, which emits light when it returns to the ground state. However, when oxygen is present, it can peroxidize other compounds instead, reducing the luminescence. This is due to the fact that the quantum efficiency of the products formed by oxygen peroxidation may be lower than that of the group on the enzyme, resulting in less light emission."

Different intermediates were responsible for the oxidative colorimetric changes with epinephrine and ferrocytochrome c, and submicromolar amounts of oxidant were detectable. Catalase diminished the absorbance change with epinephrine, but it did not stop the conversion of arachidonate to prostaglandins. This result indicates that small amounts of H2O2 were formed when producing the colorimetric change, and these had no apparent effect upon the enzyme stability. No colorimetric changes were detected during the time-dependent loss of oxygenase activity caused by various acetylenic acids, indicating that negligible amounts of H2O2 were formed. Nevertheless, the destructive action of the acetylenic acid was prevented by catalase, and it thereby appeared due to small amounts of H2O2 generated in situ as a result of a metastable complex of enzyme, oxygen and the acetylenic substrate analog.",

The liposomes were peroxidized and the erythrocytes suffered oxidation of hemoglobin followed by lysis. The oxidation of hemoglobin followed by lysis. The oxidation of hemoglobin, within the exposed erythrocytes, could be largely prevented by prior conversion to carbon monoxyhemoglobin, without preventing lysis. Hemolysis thus appeared to be a consequence of direct oxidative attack on the cell stroma. The enzyme-generated flux of O2- and of H2O2 also inactivated the xanthine oxidase. Superoxide dismutase or catalase, present in the suspending medium, protected the liposomes against peroxidation, the erythrocytes against lysis, and the xanthine oxidase against inactivation. Scavengers of O2('deltag), such as histidine or 2,5-dimethylfuran, which do not react with O2- or H2O2, also prevented peroxidation of liposomes and lysis of erythrocytes when present at low concentrations. In contrast a scavenger of OH-, such as mannitol was ineffective at low concentrations and provided significant protection only at much higher concentrations.

This suggests that the lysis of erythrocytes was a consequence of direct oxidative attack on the cell stroma, rather than the oxidation of hemoglobin itself. The oxidation of hemoglobin, O2- and H2O2, and the subsequent production of OH- and O2('deltag) were the proximate causes of lipid peroxidation and hemolysis."

    "input": "The enzymatic oxidation of E-3,4-bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-hex-3-ene (diethylstilbestrol) by either mushroom tyrosinase or rat liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH and air yields a catechol. Upon further oxidation of both compounds with periodate and condensation of the resulting o-quinones with o-phenylenediamine, phenazines are produced. The phenazines derived from the products of both the plant and animal enzyme systems are identical to the product obtained by oxidation of diethylstilbestrol with potassium nitrosodisulfonate and condensation of the o-quinone produced with o-phenylenediamine. High and low resolution mass spectra of the phenazine are consistent with its derivation from a catechol having two fewer hydrogens than diethylstilbestrol.",

A seriies of N-alkyl glycines were also oxidized by this enzyme. 2. N-Acetyl- and N-Phenylglycine inhibited the oxidase by competing with the substrate, while N-methyl-N-acetylglycine did not bind to the enzyme. This suggests the requirement of at least one unsubstituted hydrogen atom at the amino group ofglycine for binding. 3. The primary step in the reaction was the release of a proton from the substrate, indicating the formation of a substituted imino acid, which was spontaneously hydrolyzed to glyoxylic acid acid and an amine.",
    "output": "For glycine to bind to the D-amino-acid oxidase enzyme, it requires at least one unsubstituted hydrogen atom at the amino group. This is based on the observation that N-Acetyl- and N-Phenylglycine, which have substitutions at the amino group, inhibit the oxidase, while N-methyl-N-acetylglycine, which does not have an unsubstituted hydrogen atom at the amino group, does not bind to the enzyme."

Only one definite cell type was revealed by all these antisera. All granules of each individual immunostained cell reacted regardless of the antiserum used. The immunostained cells occurred in groups and were sometimes located in the wall of the follicle-like structures commonly observed in the fetal anterior pituitary. The cells revealed two main aspects: 1) The largest elements were rich in organelles, and their numerous secretory granules showed significantly variations in size (250-500 nm in diameter), electron density of their content and stain-deposit intensity. The ergastoplasm, consisting of irregular tubules, was poorly developed. In the vicinity of the conspicuous Golgi apparatus, organelles related to the GERL complex were commonly observed. Multivesicular bodies were frequent. Some of these cells showed bundles of microfilaments (60 nm in thickness). 2) The smaller cells had an electron-lucent hyaloplasm with sparse organelles; they contained fewer granules and never showed microfilaments. The immunocytological results are consistent with the synthesis of a molecule similar to pro-opiocortin by this type of endocrine cell in human fetuses.

To clearly identify the nervous structures containing ACTH in the rat brain, an immunohistochemical localization of this peptide was conducted at both light and electron microscopic levels. Nervous fibers staining for ACTH were found to be largely distributed throughout regions of hypothalamus, thalamus, and midbrain. Positive fibers could also be occasionally observed in the spinal cord. Immunostained neuronal cell bodies were only detected in the arcuate nucleus. Essentially, the same results were obtained 2 and 8 weeks after hypophysectomy. In animals pretreated with colchicine, the intensity in the staining of cell bodies was markedly increased, making possible the detection of a larger number of cell bodies. At the electron microscopic level, it was demonstrated that ACTH is contained in dense core vesicles present in nervous fibers and endings. These results indicate that ACTH of nonpituitary origin is synthesized in the central nervous system and could probably be considered as a neurotransmitter of still undefined function.",

The general trends of sleep stages were computed. Aging in normal subjects was characterized by a sharp decrease of stage 4, but a good stability of stage 3. Insomniacs' sleep showed a sleep-waking imbalance and a marked deficiency in stages 3 and 4. This deficiency seems to be similar to the age effect in normals, but more accentuated; it cannot be attributed merely to increased pressure of wakefulness. We suggest that slow wave sleep is involved in sleep induction and maintenance, and that its deficiency is linked to the fragility of sleep in chronic primary insomnia.",

    "input": "In 8 young adult human subjects EEG- and polygraphic characteristics of transient shifts towards arousal (micro-arousal, MA) have been studied during sleep under five different experimental conditions in 40 night sessions. Out of the five applied experimental situations, two (psychostimulant application and sensory stimulation) resulted in a shift of the balance between the systems of sleep and arousal towards an increased activity of the arousal system, while an other condition (rebound following partial sleep deprivation) led to an opposite change to a rise in \"sleep pressure\". An inverse correlation has been found between the frequency of MA and the depth of sleep, a finding consistently observed in every subject and in every experimental situation. During the process of sleep periodic changes in the dispersity of MA could be seen; the number of MA-s decreased and increased according to the descending and ascending slope of the sleep cycles. During the ascending slope of cycles there was a coupling between the occurence of MA-s and the changes of phases. Increases in the level of activation and in sleep pressure did not influence the occurrence of MA-s. Increasing the tone of the arousal system in chemical way, or by means of enhancing the phasic sensory input resulted in a reduction of the difference between the number of MA on the descending and ascending slopes of cycles. During the phases of sleep, the spontaneous occurrence of MA-s went parallel with the possibility to evoke MA-s by sensory stimuli. These data show that MA is a regular phenomenon of nocturnal sleep; MA manifests itself as a result of phasic functioning of the reticular arousal system and plays a role in the organization of those periods of the sleep cycle, which tend toward arousal. It is suggested that MA-phenomenon is considered a standard measure of sleep and that it could represent an indicator of the function of the arousal system controlled by external or internal mechanisms during sleep.",

Changes occurred asynchronously with a relative independence between the various brain structures during slow sleep. On the other hand, during REM sleep, all parameters reveal a high degree of synchronization of the activities. It is suggested that during slow wave sleep each of the separate rhythms display their own regulation, while in paradoxical sleep, it is their inter-relationships which are mainly controlled. The REM stage probably has some other function, associated with the fact that a neuronal population which has taken no part in any activity during wakefulness now reacts.",

Ten additional subjects were sleep-deprived for 40 h with 1 h periods of exercise given in place of naps. One recovery night followed the 40 h period for both groups. Total sleep time and the amount of stage REM during the naps were negatively related to the circadian-temperature cycle. Stage REM frequently appeared within 10 min of stage 1 onset and the normal sequence of stages REM and 4 were altered, demonstrating that the organization of sleep within a nap is quite different from that in monophasic nocturnal sleep. Auto-correlation and cross-correlation analyses showed that the relation of sleep stages from hour to hour in normal continuous baseline sleep was altered in nap-to-nap comparison. The timing of REM onset may be controlled by a sleep-dependent ultradian clock; the clock may stop upon awakening and resume at the next sleep onset. Naps had recuperative value in terms of maintaining the normal amounts of sleep stages on the recovery night; recovery sleep for the exercise group showed typical sleep-loss effects.",
    "output": "The normal sequence of REM (Rapid Eye Movement) and 4 stages in the naps taken by adult males was altered. This means that the usual progression from stage 1, to stage 4, and then to REM during a single sleep cycle was not maintained in the naps. Instead, REM frequently appeared within 10 minutes of stage 1 onset, and the sequence of stages was disrupted. This suggests that the organization of sleep within a nap is different from that in monophasic nocturnal sleep."

Validity of these automated REM measures was established by significant correlations with manually scored REM measures. Changes in REM sleep across the night were also investigated. Similar to findings in normal subjects, REM time did not change from REM period to REM period. Average REM size increased significantly from REM period 2-3 and 3-4. Contrary to what is seen in normal subjects, REM frequency was high during the first REM period, significantly decreased from the first to second REM period and then remained constant.

This paper addresses the complaint of sleepiness objectively by an attempt to differentiate a group of control subjects from a group of patients with unambiguous narcolepsy. Fourteen control and 27 narcoleptic subjects were evaluated by one of three protocols involving nocturnal recordings, detailed interviews, and 5 or more 20-min opportunities to sleep offered at 2-h intervals beginning at 10.00 o'clock, +/- 30 min. Each 20-min opportunity to sleep was given to subjects lying in a darkened quiet room and asked to try to fall asleep. Polysomnographic variables were monitored and sleep was scored in 30-sec epochs by standard criteria. The interval from the start of each test to the first epoch of NREM (including stage 1 sleep) or REM sleep was called sleep latency. In two of the protocols, the subjects were awakened immediately after sleep onset. In the third protocol, the subjects were awakened after 10 min of sleep. Narcoleptics consistently fell asleep much more readily than did control subjects. We conclude that the Multiple Sleep latency test, in addition to providing opportunities to clinically document sleep onset REM sleep periods, can demonstrate pathological sleepiness. Based on these data, we suggest that an average sleep latency less than 5 min be set as the minimum cutoff point for pathological sleepiness.",

Two groups each of 18 healthy male university students were classified as either irregular sleepers or control subjects according to retrospective questionnaires, and sleep chart criteria. The control group was composed of persons who slept naturally from 12-8:00 a.m. for 7-8 hr. Irregular sleepers were defined as those whose retiring and awakening times varied by about 2-4 hr. Measurements were obtained from an auditory reaction time task, a mood adjective check list, of sublingual temperature and pulse rate 30 min. after awakening in the (a) morning, at (b) noon, in the (c) afternoon and (d) early evening following an electroencephalographically recorded 12-8:00 a.m. sleep night. At various points in the diurnal cycle irregular sleepers compared with the control group had significantly lower levels of pulse rate and body temperature, but significantly longer reaction times. During the four time periods negative affects (deactivation-sleep, depression, general deactivation, inert-fatigued) were significantly greater and positive mood states (cheerful, energetic, general activation--significantly less in the irregular sleepers. The irregular sleepers averaged significantly less stage 4, and REM, but more stage 2 and transitions between sleep stages. The present results indicate that relatively lowered levels of physiological arousal indexes, psychomotor performance and subjective mood are associated with irregularity in chronic sleep routines of young adult males. These psychobehavioral correlates of chronically maintained sleep pattern variations complement and extend previous findings on degradations in waking functions following acute 2-4 hr temporal shifts of habitual sleep periods. It is postulated that there were psychobehavioral deficits in the irregular sleepers attributable either to selective sleep stage (REM and/or stage 4) deprivation or to the more general consequence of disturbed sleeping patterns per se or to both of these factors.",

    "input": "Effects of glucose concentration and anoxia upon the metabolite concentrations and rates of glycolysis and respiration have been investigated in the perfused liver of the fetal guinea pig. In most cases the metabolite concentrations in the perfused liver were similar to those observed in vivo. Between 50 days and term there was a fall in the respiratory rate and in the concentration of ATP and fructose 1,6-diphosphate and an increase in the concentration of glutamate, glycogen and glucose. Reducing the medium glucose concentration from 10 mM to 1 mM or 0.1 mM depressed lactate production and the concentration of most of the phosphorylated intermediates (except 6-phosphogluconate) in the liver of the 50-day fetus. This indicates a fall in glycolytic rate which is not in accord with the known kinetic properties of hexokinase in the fetal liver. Anoxia increased lactate production by, and the concentrations of, the hexose phosphates ADP and AMP in the 50-day to term fetal liver, while the concentration of ribulose 5-phosphate, ATP and some triose phosphates fell. These results are consistent with an activation of glycolysis, particularly at phosphofructokinase and of a reduction in pentose phosphate pathway activity, particularly at 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. The calculated cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratio for the perfused liver was similar to that measured in vivo and evidence is presented to suggest that the dihydroxyacetone phosphate/glycerol 3-phosphate ratio gives a better indication of cytosolic redox than the lactate/pyruvate ratio. The present observations indicate that phosphofructokinase hexokinase and possibly pyruvate kinase control the glycolytic rate and that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is at equilibrium in the perfused liver of the fetal guinea pig.",

Other procedures were shown to stimulate the activity of phosphorylase and depress the activity of glycogen in the liver. The direction of glycogen metabolism appears to be regulated by the relative proportions of the two enzymes, as shown by a strong positive correlation between total activities and active forms of phosphorylase and synthase. The enzyme activities responded as expected to stimuli such as insulin and glucose, which depressed phosphorylase and increased synthase activity, and glucagon, which increased phosphorylase and decreased synthase activity. In fasted animals approximately 50% of each enzyme was in the active form, which suggests the existence of a potential futile cycle for glycogen metabolism. The role for such a cycle in the regulation of glycogen synthesis and degradation is discussed.",

Accumulation of glycogen in liver tissue of the patients was caused by distinct decrease in the phosphorylase activity. In two patients low activity of phosphorylase A was due to impairment of one of the enzymes, activating the phosphorylase in liver tissue, and in one patient phosphorylase B itself exhibited low activity. The in vitro data on glycogen metabolism were correlated with those, obtained in study of glycogen turnover in vivo, after loading with adrenaline. The data obtained enable to develop methods for treatment of the patients with impairments in activity of liver phosphorylase.",

    "input": "1. The metabolism of glucose labeled uniformly with 14C, and in positions 2, 3 and 5 with tritium by hepatocytes from fed and fasted rats were studied. Cells were incubated with glucose as sole substrate, or with glucose and a variety of glucose precursors, and uptake or production of glucose, and the utilization of the isotopes was determined. 2. There was no uptake of glucose at concentration of up to 15 mM, and net glucose synthesis in the presence of precursors. 14C was however recovered in CO2, lactate and amino acids, and tritium in water. Considerable incorporation into glycogen from 14C and 3H-labeled glucose occurred at high (above 20 mM) glucose concentrations. 3. The yield in water always exceeded that in 14C-labeled products. The yield in 3HOH from [2-3H] glucose exceeded that from [5-3H] glucose, and the latter was greater than from [3-3H] glucose. 4. Utilization of labeled glucose does not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The fractional rate of uptake of 14C and tritium-labeled glucose increases with glucose concentration with a maximum at about 15 mM and then declines. 5. The effect of numerous gluconeogenic substrates on the isotope utilization and the 3H/14C ratio in glycogen was studied. The uptake of 14C was always depressed. Addition of lactate and dihydroxyacetone has little effect on the detritiation of [2-3H] glucose, but it is depressed by other substrates. The detritiation of [3-3H]-and[5-3H]glucose is depressed in gluconeogenesis, that from [3-3H]glucose usually more than from [5-3H]glucose. In the presence of lactate detritiation of [3-3H]glucose is about half that from [5-3H]glucose. 6. Equations to calculate the phosphorylation of glucose and fructose 6-phosphate in the presence of futile cycling between glucose and glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate were derived. 7. The estimate of glucose phosphorylation requires determination of the specific activity of glucose 6-phosphate from [2-3H]glucose. It appears that futile cycling between glucose and glucose 6-phosphate is extensive in cells with a high glycogen content, but is low in cells from starved rats and nearly absent in those from diabetic animals. 8. The estimation of the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate in the presence of cycling requires knowledge of the specific activities of fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate from [3-3H]glucose. At present there are no adqquate data to calculate phosphorylation and recycling of fructose 6-phosphate, but under some conditions the rate may be quite high.",
    "output": "In the metabolism of glucose by hepatocytes from fed and fasted rats, the yield of water (tritium) is always greater than the yield of 14C-labeled products. The yield of tritium from [2-3H] glucose is higher than from [5-3H] glucose, and the latter is greater than from [3-3H] glucose. This indicates that more tritium is incorporated into water molecules during the metabolism of glucose, particularly when the glucose is labeled at position 2.\n\nMoreover, the utilization of labeled glucose does not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the fractional rate of uptake of 14C and tritium-labeled glucose increases with glucose concentration, reaching a maximum at about 15 mM, and then declines.\n\nThe uptake of 14C is always depressed by numerous gluconeogenic substrates, with the detritiation of [3-3H]glucose being more depressed than [5-3H]glucose. In the presence of lactate, the detritiation of [3-3H]glucose is about half that from [5-3H]glucose. These findings suggest that the metabolism of glucose is affected by the presence of other substrates and that the metabolism of glucose may be more active in the presence of high glucose concentrations.\n\nFurthermore, the paper discusses the phosphorylation of glucose and fructose 6-phosphate in the presence of futile cycling between these compounds, and suggests that futile cycling is extensive in cells with a high glycogen content, but is low in cells from starved rats and nearly absent in those from diabetic animals. However, there are no adequate data to calculate phosphorylation and recycling of fructose 6-phosphate at present."

Decrease in the ratio NAD+/NADH showed that the nicotinamide nucleotide pool acquired the most distinct reducing properties of cytoplasma and mitochondria of rats maintained on the diet.

    "instruction": "What was the apparent Km for glucose utilization by the isolated rat lung cells?",
    "input": "Isolated rat lung cell suspensions were prepared by collagenase digestion of the lung stroma. These cells were functionally competent as judged, among other criteria, by their constant rates of oxygen uptake and glucose utilization. An important metabolic feature of these cells is that they display very high glycolytic rates. At least 60% of the glucose utilized was converted to lactate, regardless of the glucose concentration in the medium. The state of reduction of the nicotinamide system, as indicated by the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio, was normal, thus indicating that the high glycolytic fluxes are not related to poor oxygenation of the preparation. Utilization of glucose displayed Michaelis-Menten saturation type kinetics with a Vmax of 331 nmol/10(6) cells per h and an apparent Km of 2.4 mM. These values were not affected by the presence of ouabain (0.1 mM), mannoheptulose (5 mM), or insulin (1 mU/ml), whereas phloridzin produced a drastic inhibition of glucose utilzation showing an apparent Ki of 0.4 mM. The substitution of sodium by K+ or Li+ as the predominant cations in the incubation medium does not alter rates of glucose utilization. Optimal pH for glucose utilization was within the physiological range with a more pronounced inhibitory effect at alkaline pH's. The intracellular concentration glucose was found to be low. This finding, in conjunction with a Q10 (27-37 degrees C) for glucose utilization above 2.0 and the differential effects of D- and L-glucose on production, seems to indicate that a stereospecific glucose transport system exists in lung cells. Several findings point to glucose transport into the lung cells as a probable rate-limiting step for its metabolism:1) the activity of the glycolytic enzymes largely exceeded the observed rate of glucose utilization;2) the decrease in enzyme activity during starvation was not accompanied by a decreased glycolytic flux, suggesting that factors other than enzyme activity, perhaps the supply of fuel, are rate limiting in the overall process of glucose breakdown;3) fructose was able to increase lactate production in the presence of saturating concentrations of glucose. These additive effects of glucose and fructose seem to support the point of view that it is not the glycolytic machinery but the supply of fuel which is rate limiting for glucose utilization by isolated rat lung cells.",

The activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49), malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37), and malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) (NADP) (EC 1.1.1.40), on the other hand, was unchanged. Since both hexokinase and 6-phosphofructokinase are rate-limiting in glycolysis, their enhanced activity would indicate the occurrence of an increased capacity to metabolize glucose and therefore to generate alpha-glycerophosphate. The elevation of ATP citrate-lyase would suggest increased lipogenesis, owing to the regulatory role that this enzyme plays in fatty acid synthesis. The normal activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) (NADP), which supply NADPH for the reduction of acetyl-CoA to fatty acids, would suggest that the change in lipogenesis is of moderate degree, thereb) affecting only the most rate-limiting enzyme, ATP citrate-lyase. These data, on the whole, are consistent with the occurrence of enhanced triglyceride formation. Whether the enzyme changes observed are adaptive or genetic in nature remains to be clarified.",

    "instruction": "What percentage of the cell dry weight is fat in Candida 107 when it is grown on glucose?",
    "input": "Enzymes of glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, gluconeogenesis, tricarboxylate acid cycle, glyoxylate by-pass and fatty-acid biosynthesis were assayed in extracts from Candida 107 grown continuously on glucose under carbon limitation, nitrogen limitation and on n-alkanes. The yeast was therefore either in a lipogenic or lipolytic state. Phosphofructokinase was absent under all conditions whereas enzymes of gluconeogenesis, including fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and the pentose phosphate cycle, were all present. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were specific for NADP+ and were inhibited in a non-competitive manner by NADPH and NADH. Phosphoenolpyruvate, citrate, ATP and acetyl CoA had no inhibitory effects. Thus glucose metabolism appears to be by the pentose phosphate pathway which will rapidly produce NADPH. This can readily be consumed during fatty-acid biosynthesis and, as there appears to be no inhibition of the flow of carbon from glucose to acetyl CoA, fatty-acid synthesis can continue for as long as there is a supply of glucose. These results help to explain the probable causes of fat build-up to high concentrations (about 40% of the cell dry weight) in this and other organisms. In alkane-grown cells, lipogenesis is repressed and carbon is able to flow from the alkanes via acetyl CoA, oxaloacetate and pyruvate into pentoses and hexoses in a unidirectional manner, because of the strong repression of pyruvate kinase and the increased activities of phosphoenolpyruvate kinase and fructose 1,6-biosphosphatase under these conditions. Although there was little change in the total activity of the TCA cycle enzymes under the various growth conditions, isocitrate lyase was induced under lipolytic conditions.",
    "output": "The context does not provide a specific percentage for the amount of fat in Candida 107 when it is grown on glucose. However, it does mention that fat can build up to high concentrations, about 40% of the cell dry weight.

    "input": "The contribution to the glycolytic flux by glycogen breakdown versus glucose phosphorylation has been determined in isolated fetal rat hepatocytes, prepared in different media and subsequently incubated with different glucose concentrations. A high glucose concentration in cells prepared in a medium containing a high concentration of inorganic phosphate decreases the contribution to the glycolytic flux by glycogenolysis to less than 15%. It is suggested that one of the factors which initiate glycogenolysis in the living animal after birth is a lowered blood glucose concentration, independent of hormonal changes. Under conditions where glycogenolysis does not contribute the larger part to the glycolytic flux, the control of glycolysis is shifted from glycogen breakdown to the glucose phosphorylation step and phosphofructokinase.",

Hepatocytes from starved rats or fed rats whose glycogen content was previously depleted by phlorrhizin or by glucagon injections, form glycogen at rapid rates when incubated with 10mM-glucose, gluconeogenic precursors (lactate, glycerol, fructose etc.) and glutamine. There is a net synthesis of glucose and glycogen. 14C from all three types of substrate is incorporated into glycogen, but the incorporation from glucose represents exchange of carbon atoms, rather than net incorporation. 14C incorporation does not serve to measure net glycogen synthesis from any one substrate. 2. With glucose as sole substrate net glucose uptake and glycogen deposition commences at concentrations of about 12--15mM. Glycogen synthesis increases with glucose concentrations attaining maximal values at 50--60mM, when it is similar to that obtained in the presence of 10mM glucose and lactate plus glutamine. 3. The activities of the active (a) and total (a+b) forms of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase were monitored concomitant with glycogen synthesis. Total synthase was not constant during a 1 h incubation period. Total and active synthase activity increased in parallel with glycogen synthesis. 4. Glycogen phosphorylase was assayed in two directions, by conversion of glycose 1-phosphate into glycogen and by the phosphorylation of glycogen. Total phosphorylase was assyed in the presence of AMP or after conversion into the phosphorylated form by phosphorylase kinase. Results obtained by the various methods were compared. Although the rates measured by the procedures differ, the pattern of change during incubation was much the same. Total phosphorylase was not constant. 5. The amounts of active and total phosphorylase were highest in the washed cell pellet. Incubation in an oxygenated medium, with or without substrates, caused a prompt and pronounced decline in the assayed amounts of active and total enzyme. There was no correlation between phosphorylase activity and glycogen synthesis from gluconeogenic substrates. With fructose, active and total phosphorylase activities increased during glycogen syntheses. 6. In glycogen synthesis from glucose as sole substrate there was a decline in phosphorylase activities with increased glucose concentration and increased rates of glycogen deposition. The decrease was marked in cells from fed rats. 7. To determine whether phosphorolysis and glycogen synthesis occur concurrently, glycogen was prelabelled with [2-3H,1-14C]-galactose. During subsequent glycogen deposition there was no loss of activity from glycogen in spite of high amounts of assayable active phosphorylase.",

The number of haplotypes in disequilibrium is relatively limited since most of the significant Ds involved about 17 haplotypes. For some haplotypes, the disequilibrium covered the whole distance from A to GLO but the stronger disequilibrium concerns the C to Bf or C to DR segment.

In infants with developmental disorders, the frequency of rare electrophoretic protein variants was found to be about one order of magnitude higher than in the control.

Samples from generation 18 and 28 were electrophoretically typed for ADH and alpha-GPDH. In addition, samples from generation 27 were analyzed for the presence of inversion heterozygotes. The experimental results showed rapid gene-frequency divergence between control and treatment populations at the Adh locus in a direction consistent with the activity hierarchy of Adh genotypes. Gene-frequency divergence between control and treatment populations also occurred at the alpha-Gpdh locus, although the agreement among replicates appeared to have broken down by generation 28. No differential gene-frequency change occurred at any of the six remaining marker loci. Furthermore, values of linkage disequilibria among all linked pairs of genes were initially small and remained small throughout the course of the experiment. Taking these facts into account, it is argued that the gene-frequency response observed at ADH is most probably caused by selection at the Adh locus.

The delta-chains of Hb A2 can be regarded as a duplication of the beta-locus. We have presented the first evidence for the presence of two major alpha-chain loci in man. The alpha-gene appears to have duplicated recently, since apart of the single point mutations characterizing Hb J-Buda and Hb G-Pest, the two alpha-gene products seem to be identical. Sensitive immunochemical measurement techniques may reveal structural differences which might escape detection by chemical methods based on differences in charge and/or chromatographic behaviour. Anti-alpha-chain sera recognizing the single amino acid substitution in alphaJ-Buda could be raised in rabbits. The anti-alpha-chain sera were found to be more powerful tools for detecting differences in the primary structure of the chain than the immune sera raised against the whole tetramer. None of the immune sera could reliably differentiate Hb G-Pest from Hb A1. The relative strength of complement fixation of the alpha-chains from haemoglobin A1 F and A2 was compared by hybridizing these human haemoglobins with caninehaemoglobin and measuring the quantitative complement fixation of the different hybrids with anti-Hb A1 and anti-alphaA1 rabbit immune sera. No antigenic difference among the alpha-chains from haemoglobins A1, A2 and F could be detected by this method either with anti-A1 or with anti-alphaA1 sera. These results do not exclude the possibility of conformational differences between the alpha-chains in native Hb A and Hb F. The antigenic activity of the alpha-chains of Hb A from normal subjects (alphaA1) and of the alpha-chains of Hb A from a double heterozygote for alphaJ-Buda and alphaG-Pest (alphaA1) were compared by the complement fixation technique.

    "input": "The Escherichia coli dnaZ gene, a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerization gene, is located 1.2 min counterclockwise from purE, at approximately min 10.5 on the E. coli map. From a lysogen with lamdacI857 integrated at a secondary attachment site near purE, transducing phages (lambdadnaS+) that transduced a dnaZts (lambda+) recipient to temperature insensitivity (TS+) were discovered. Three different plaque-forming transducing phages were isolated from seven primary heterogenotes. Genetic tests and heteroduplex mapping were used to determine the length and position of E. coli DNA within the lambda DNA. Complementation tests demonstrated that the deletions in all three strains removed both att P and the int gene, i,e., DNA from both prophage ends. Heteroduplex mapping confirmed this result by demonstrating that all three strains had deletions of lambda DNA that covered the b2 to red region, thereby removing both prophage ends. Specifically, the deletions removed lambda DNA between the points 39.3 to 66.5% of lambda length (measured in percent length from the left and of lambda phage DNA) in all three strains. The three strains are distinct, however, because they had differing lengths of host DNA insertions. These phages must have been formed by an anomalous procedure, because standard lambda transducing phages are deleted for one prophage end only. In lambdagal and lambdabio strains, the deletions of lambda DNA begin at the union of prophage ends (i.e., position 57.3% of lambda length) and extend leftward or rightward, respectively (Davidson and Szybalski, in A, D. Hershey [ed.], The Bacteriophage Lambda, p. 45-82, 1971). Models for formation of the lambdadnaZ+ phages are discussed.",
    "output": "The deletions of lambda DNA in both lambdagal and lambdabio strains begin at a location that is 57.3% of the lambda length, measured from the left and of lambda phage DNA. This means that the initial point of the deletions is slightly more than half the length of the lambda DNA."

    "input": "A plaque-forming lambdapolA phage was isolated from a population of transducing phage made in vitro from Escherichia coli DNA and a phage vector digested with restriction endonuclease HindIII. Amber mutations, in genes whose products are necessary for late protein synthesis (Q) and cell lysis (S), were crossed into the lambdapolA phage. Infection of either polA+ or polA- bacteria with this phage, under conditions permitting DNA replication but preventing phage production and lysis, elevated the levels of DNA polymerase I to between 75- and 100-fold that detected in a wild-type strain. The kinetics of enzyme production suggest that the polA gene is transcribed from its own promoter rather than from any of the well-characterized phage promoters. The fragment of E. coli DNA within the lambdapolA phage comprises approximately 5000 base pairs, sufficient to accommodate the polA gene and one, or two, coding sequences for smaller proteins.",

The relatively high recA-independent recombination observed in this system contrasts with the relatively low recA-independent recombination when recombinant phage particles rather than recombinant DNA are titrated. Formation of the recombinant DNA was suppressed by the the addition of rifampin. The introduction of the rif-r mutation into host bacteria made their recombination activity rifampin-resistant. These results show that DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.6) is involved in this recA-independent pathway of recombination, which is named the \"Rpo pathway.\" This is distinct from Red, Int, RecBC, RecE, or Der pathways of recombination. Crossover was much more frequent in the N-PL-cI and cI-PR-O regions than in the A-D and O-S regions. The crossover seems to occur in the regions that are transcribed actively. Some local change of DNA structure caused by transcription might be required for the Rpo pathway of recombination.",

Consequently these minicells have acquired the capability to direct the synthesis of phage-specific RNA and protein. Comparision of the electrophoretic mobilities of phage-specific RNA species made in vitro with those made in M13 replicative form DNA harbouring minicells, have indicated that almost all in vitro synthesized G-start RNAs have an equivalent among the in vivo synthesized RNA products. Furthermore it could be demonstrated that in M13 replicative form DNA harbouring minicells the phage-specific proteins encoded by genes III, IV, V and VIII are made. In addition the synthesis of a phage-specific polypeptide (molecular weight approx. 3000) co-migrating with the recently discovered capsid protein (designated C-protein) could be demonstrated. The meaning of these results for the resolution of the regulatory mechanisms operative during the life cycle of this phage will be discussed.",

We have devised a new way of examining the physical structures of the intermediates of these processes. It is based on the observation that there are no sites in T7 DNA susceptible to cleavage by the restriction endonuclease EcoRI. E. coli DNA, on the other hand, is susceptible to degradation by EcoRI. Thus, phage and host DNA can be separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation after treatment with EcoRI. Concatemeric T7 DNA contains a high proportion of branched, gapped, and whiskered structures. These appear to be intermediates of replication and recombination. This approach also monitors the conversion process from host to T7 DNA.",
    "output": "The enzyme used to separate phage (T7) and host DNA based on their susceptibility to degradation is EcoRI, a restriction endonuclease. EcoRI is able to degrade E. coli DNA, but not T7 DNA due to the lack of specific sites susceptible to cleavage in T7 DNA. This property allows for the separation of the two types of DNA through sucrose gradient centrifugation after treatment with EcoRI."

This phage transduces with high frequency (i) several temperature-sensitive PRS mutants to thermoresistance and (ii) a p-fluorophenylalanine resistant PRS mutant to sensitivity against this amino-acid analog. The in vitro PRS activities of such lysogens suggest that the alpha and beta subunits coded by the transducing phage complement the mutant host PRS-subunits in vivo by means of formation of hybrid enzymes. The transducing lambda phages were also used to infect UV light irradiated cells. The SDS-gel electrophoretic analysis of the proteins synthesized in such cells revealed that the phage codes at least for four different E. coli proteins. Two proteins with molecular weights of 94,000 and 38,000 daltons cross-reacted with an anti PRS serum and were thus identified as the beta and alpha subunits of PRS, respectively. A third protein with a molecular weight of 22,000 daltons is identical with the ribosomal initiation factor IF3 (Springer et al., 1977b). The other protein (Mr 78,000) is still unidentified.",

Nondefective transducing lambda phages for these genes were isolated. Low-frequency-transducing donors were constructed starting from lysogens of lambda cI857 in which the prophage is integrated at a secondary attachment site at 44 min on the E. coli map. Two strategies were used to delete the region between the prophage and the fla genes. Deletion mutants of the supD locus between fla and the prophage were isolated by selecting for loss of Su1+, an allele of supD. A strain with a deletion starting within the prophage and ending at a position close to the fla genes was isolated from heat-resistant derivatives of the lysogen. A lysogen of lambda b2 was then constructed in which the prophage had integrated at the site of the defective prophage by means of recombination with residual lambda deoxyribonucleic acid. From low-frequency-transducing lysate of the donor strains thus constructed, either directly or in combination with a procedure that extends the loci transduced, various lambda pfla's were isolated. lambda pflaL1 carries all nine fla genes at 43 min, and lambda pflaH14 carries hag and two fla genes at 42.5 min.",

From the known structures of these phage genomes, it has been possible to determine the relative order of many of these genes on the lambdafus2 genome and thus on the E. coli chromosome.

In this study, blood pressure was measured by a direct cannulation of the abdominal aorta. Subcutaneous administration of carteolol and pindolol caused a significant fall in mean blood pressure in both normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats, whereas propranolol produced a rise in blood pressure. Maximum fall in blood pressure was observed 3 approximately 7 hr after the administration of carteolol and pindolol. In order to determine the beta-blocking action, changes in heart rate and blood pressure in response to isoproterenol (3 microgram/kg i.v.) were observed during the experiment. beta-Blocking action was found as early as 1 hr after subcutaneous administration.

The study was of single blind crossover design. Propranolol given in oral doses ranging from 60 to 240 mg daily for a period of 3 weeks decreased blood pressure and heart rate. The beta-adrenergic blocking agent caused plasma catecholamine levels to increase both at rest and during bicycle exercise. Chromatographical analysis showed that concentrations of noradrenaline as well as of adrenaline rose during treatment with propranolol. However, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity in plasma was not altered. Furthermore, the urinary excretion of noradrenaline, adrenaline and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy mandelic acid did not change during beta receptor blockade. The results are compatible with the assumption that antihypertensive doses of propranolol by decreasing cardiac output cause an activation of the sympatho-adrenal system.",

The synchronous reduction in blood pressure and heart rate after propranolol was not associated with an increase in peripheral sympathietic activity as assessed by the biochemical indices.

    "input": "1. Enzymes must not only be extremely effective catalysts, but must also be the operating components of very sensitive and sophisticated regulatory systems. Appropriate evolutionary adjustment of the properties of different enzymes causes the sites that bind typical metabolic intermediates to be only partially saturated in vivo, thus allowing flexibility for control by variation in ligand concentration. In contrast, sites that bind such coupling agents as the pyridine and adenine nucleotides seem to be virtually saturated. Thus the ratios, rather than the absolute concentrations, of these compounds are important in metabolic regulation. This type of response is esstial to the function of these compounds simultaneously as thermodynamic energy transducers and modifiers in the kinetics regulatory system. 2. Reaction orders of two to four are frequently encountered. They appear to be essenital to biochemical homoeostasis, which is the maintenance of nearly constant substrate concentrations at the expense of wide variation in flux rates. 3. The strategies of enzyme adaptation are general, but the actual adaptations of enzymes are highly specific, reflecting the place of the enzyme in a metabolic sequence, the place of the sequence in the metabolism of the cell and, in complex organisms, the function of the cell, and of the organ or tissue of which it is a part, in the organism. Patterns of adaptation must be almost infinitely varied. A few are presently known in outline, but probably none as yet in detail. Several examples are discussed.",
    "output": "The significance of the ratios, rather than the absolute concentrations, of compounds like pyridine and adenine nucleotides in metabolic regulation lies in their role as both thermodynamic energy transducers and modifiers in the kinetics regulatory system. These compounds, when bound to enzymes, create sites that are virtually saturated, meaning their concentrations remain relatively constant.\n\nHowever, it's the ratios of these compounds that are crucial for regulation, not their absolute concentrations. This is because these ratios can be adjusted to control the activity of enzymes, which in turn affects the metabolic pathways they are part of. This flexibility is essential for biochemical homeostasis, which is the maintenance of nearly constant substrate concentrations, despite wide variations in flux rates.\n\nIn other words, the ratios of these compounds help maintain a stable metabolic environment while allowing for dynamic adjustments in response to changing cellular needs. This is achieved through the highly specific adaptations of enzymes, which are influenced by their position in metabolic sequences, the function of the cell, and the organ or tissue they are a part of in the organism."

    "input": "Fibrinogen plays a pivotal role in both the humoral and cellular mechanisms involved in hemostasis. In performing its hemostatic function, fibrinogen in turn is acted on by several independent enzyme systems that either modify its structure or cleave specific fragments of the molecule into the surrounding milieu. Measurements of enzymatically modified fibrinogen or its proteolysis products represent a means whereby the action of these specific enzymes can be quantitated both in vitro and in vivo. Advances in such techniques as protein purification, affinity chromatography, peptide synthesis, and radioimmunoassay technology permit the translation of recently acquired primary structural data on this important protein into sensitive and specific assays for its circulating derivatives. These assay systems are important tools for probing mechanisms of hemostasis and thrombosis.",

More generally, a macromolecule in solution possessing appropriate geometrical and elastic properties constitutes a machine, whose possible operations have common features with biological function such as passive transport, enzymatic catalysis and active transport.

The assembly of membrane-bound transport systems during embryonic development provides unique opportunities for approaching questions relating to gene expression, the synthesis and insertion of membrane proteins into phospholipid layers, the composition and structure of transport systems and the conditions required for their functioning. It seems plausible to assume that the growth and differentiation of animal cells is regulated, in part at least, by the rate of transport of metabolites and ions across the cell membranes. Therefore the sequence of the expression of transport systems is likely to have a profound effect on subsequent stages of growth and differentiation. Feedback regulation of the synthesis of transport proteins by changes in the intracellular or extracellular concentrations of the transported metabolites or ions [52, 53, 85-87] may be a key element in the regulation of the rate of transport processes during development.",

These properties of the membrane undergo some age-dependent alterations in numerous cells studied so far, resulting in an increase of the intracellular potassium content. This phenomenon has a serious inhibitory effect on the rates of enzymatic catalyses involved in the protein synthesis, and may explain the decreased protein synthetic capacity of the old cells. Data are presented indicating that some changes in the membrane permeability are also involved in the malignant transformation of the cells; however, these are of opposite direction as compared to aging of cells. The \"membrane hypothesis\" of aging based on these facts seems to be a useful experimental approach to the problem of cellular aging.",

The two-weekly incidence of diarrhoea in children in the age group 0-5 months, 6-11 months and 12-23 months, who were reported and/or observed to be ill, was 3.4%, 5.6% and 3.4% respectively. A decline in the attack rates of diarrhoea not associated with measles at the end of 1975 and the beginning of 1976 corresponds with a similar decline in the incidence of measles and malnutrition. Initially diarrhoea information was only obtained from children who where reported and/or observed to be ill; later on, all mothers were questioned about their children's diarrhoea experience at the moment of the fieldworkers's visit or in the preceding two weeks. This yielded a four to sevenfold increase in diarrhoea incidence.

A rise of the meningococcus infection incidence from 1969 to 1974 was recorded 28 years after the elevation of 1940-1942 and was 1.5 times below this latter rise. The rise in 1969-1974 was characterized by marked signs peculiar to the infection with the droplet transmission mechanism; among those who contracted the disease prevalence was seen among children aged under 14 years (63-72%). A marked affection of juveniles was noted. Three types of the dynamic of the meningococcus infection incidence in the republics located in different climatic-geographical zones of the USSR were noted: slow, gradual increase of the level, interrupted and explosive. Such character was determined in the dynamics of the seasonal elevations of morbidity. Antiepidemic measures including a complex of nonspecific measures could not be assessed as sufficiently effective. This finds reflection in the natural course of the epidemic process of the meningococcus infection which remains uncontrolled. From the patients with generalized form of the disease meningococci of group A were isolated in 80-100% of cases, from the number of those typed.

The portion of virus-specific protein synthesis in the infected cells was about 40% of the total protein synthesis. This means that with the total increase of protein synthesis 2-fold and (in some experiments) higher, the summary synthesis of cell proteins proper is not inhibited (possibly, it is slightly increased). Quite effective synthesis of virus-specific proteins for a comparatively long period after infection and ineffective maturation of virions eventually lead to a rather considerable accumulation of virus-specific proteins in the infected cells. The total content of protein in samples prepared 2 days after infection is approximately 1-1/2 as high as in uninfected samples.",

Some of these viruses have been incriminated in the development of leukemia in primates. The characteristics of blocking of viral multiplication are similar to those described for the effect of mouse interferon on ecotropic viruses. The amount of free virus in culture supernatants is strongly decreased while intracellular protein p30 stays unchanged or is slightly increased. On the other hand, the inhibitory effect is reversible. The withdrawal of interferon results in a rapid increase in virus production as detectable in supernatant fluids. In the light of these results it is suggested that human interferon might be useful in the treatment of some blood malignancies suspected of being related to infection with xenotropic type-C viruses.",

    "input": "Infection of mouse myeloma cells (MPC-11) with vesicular stomatitis (VS) virus resulted in rapid and marked reduction in cellular RNA synthesis considerably before cell viability was compromised. Mouse myeloma cells responded maximally to viral infection at a multiplicity of 1 and were considerably more se;sitive to shut-off of RNA synthesis than were mouse L cells or BHK-21 cells. This inhibition of cellular RNA synthesis was shown not to be caused by differential membrane permeability of infected and uninfected MPC-11 cells to [3H]uridine, nor was it due to greater degradation of previously synthesized RNA. VS viral infection appeared not to impede transport of newly synthesized nuclear RNA to the cytoplasm; moreover, infected cells accumulated polyadenylated mRNA at the same rate as did uninfected cells. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of newly synthesized nuclear RNA demonstrated that the polydisperse nature and size distribution were not affected by VS viral infection. Isolated nuclei of infected MPC-11 cells also inhibited greatly impaired capacity to synthesize RNA despite the absence of cytoplasmic factors. Infected-cell cytosol did not inhibit transcription by uninfected-cell nuclei, nor did uninfected-cell cytosol reverse viral inhibition of nuclear transcription. Studies with alpha-amanitin revealed that VS viral infection inhibited the activity of polymerases I, II, and III, but only polymerase II was affected progressively throughout infection and to a much greater extent. These data suggest that, even at low multiplicities of infection, VS virus rapidly shuts off cellular RNA synthesis at the level of nuclear transcription.",
    "output": "The VS viral infection had a significant effect on the activity of polymerases I, II, and III in mouse myeloma cells. The virus rapidly inhibited cellular RNA synthesis, and this inhibition occurred at the level of nuclear transcription. Among the polymerases, polymerase II was affected progressively throughout infection and to a much greater extent compared to polymerases I and III.

    "input": "Interferon (150 units/ml) was used to treat SC-1 and AKR-2B cells which were chronically infected with murine leukaemia virus (MuLV). This led to a 100-fold decrease in the amount of infectious virus released into the medium and a 10-fold decrease in the number of virus particles measured by the virion-associated reverse transcriptase assay. However, there was little change in the amount of cell-associated infectious virus, though nearly twice as many cell-associated virions were counted in electron micrographs. With both types of cells, interferon blocked MuLV replication at the post-budding stage, but it did not change the morphology of the particles produced or their content of virion 70S RNA. Infectious virus assembled on the cell membranes of interferon-treated cells was less stable at 37 degrees C than that grown in the absence of interferon. Release of infectious virus from interferon-treated cells was not inhibited by actinomycin D or cycloheximide, though both agents inhibited virus production in controls. These results show that interferon inhibits MuLV replication through effects on virion assembly; these lead both to the formation of non-infectious particles and of fewer virions. Kinetic analysis further shows that interferon affects MuLV assembly rapidly and induction of an antiviral protein may not be required.",
    "output": "The interferon treatment resulted in a decrease in the stability of infectious virus assembled on the cell membranes of treated cells at 37 degrees C.

    "input": "Several biologically distinguishable type-C RNA viruses are genetically transmitted in mouse cells. In the present report, chemicals that inhibit several different steps in protein synthesis are shown to cause marked increases in the cellular concentration of virus-specific RNA and the subsequent induction of virus. Analysis of the effect of translational inhibitors on mouse embryo cells of different genotypes indicates that activation of viral RNA is specific for one endogenous virus class and is a dominant genetic characteristic. Two lines of evidence favor the hypothesis that the induction of viral RNA involves transcriptional derepression rather than an alteration in its post-transcriptional processing. First, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of induced cells are shown to demonstrate similar increases in their concentrations of virus-specific RNA. Second, the decay of induced viral RNA following inhibition of further RNA synthesis by actinomycin D is not prevented by continued exposure to the inducer. These findings weigh heavily against the possibility that translational inhibitors act to stabilize viral RNA post-transcriptionally. The results are consistent with a model in which the expression of one class of endogenous virus is regulated by a labile repressor protein acting at a transcriptional level.",
    "output": "The proposed mechanism by which translational inhibitors cause an increase in virus-specific RNA in mouse cells is through transcriptional derepression. This means that the inhibitors might be disrupting a labile repressor protein that usually suppresses the transcription of one class of endogenous viruses. As a result, the transcription of these viruses increases, leading to an accumulation of virus-specific RNA in the cell. This increased RNA then triggers the induction of the virus. The evidence for this mechanism includes the similar increase in virus-specific RNA in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of induced cells, and the fact that the decay of induced viral RNA is not prevented by continued exposure to the inducer. This suggests that the inducer does not act to stabilize viral RNA post-transcriptionally, but rather to increase its transcription."

    "input": "Using cytochalasin B-induced enucleation techniques, we examined the ability of vaccinia virus to replicate in the absence of the host-cell nucleus in several mammalian cell lines. It was found that virus-infected enucleated cells (cytoplasts) prepared from BSC-40, CVC, and L cells were incapable of producing infectious progeny virus. The nature of this apparent nuclear involvement was studied in detail in BSC-40 cells. Modulations designed to maximize cytoplast integrity and longevity, such as reduction of the growth temperature and initial multiplicity of infection, did not improve virus growth in cytoplasts. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis of the [(35)S]methionine pulse-labeled proteins synthesized in vaccinia virus-infected cytoplasts demonstrated that both early and late viral gene products were being expressed at high levels and with the proper temporal sequence. Vaccinia virus cytoplasmic DNA synthesis, as measured by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation, peaked at 3 h postinfection and was 70 to 90% of control levels in cytoplasts. However, in the cytoplasts this DNA was not converted to a DNase-resistant form late in infection, which was consistent with the failure to isolate physical particles from infected cytoplasts. Treatment of vaccinia virus-infected cells with 100 mug of rifampin/ml from 0 to 8 h to increase the pools of viral precursors, followed by subsequent removal of the drug, resulted in a threefold increase virus yield. This treatment had no effect on virus-infected cytoplasts. Finally, vaccinia virus morphogenesis was studied under an electron microscope in thin sections of virus-infected cells and cytoplasts which had been prepared at various times during a single-step growth cycle. It was apparent that, although early virus morphogenetic forms appeared, there was no subsequent DNA condensation or particle maturation in the cytoplasts. These results suggest that vaccinia virus requires some factor or function from the host-cell nucleus in order to mature properly and produce infectious progeny virus.",
    "output": "Treating vaccinia virus-infected cells with 100 mug of rifampin/ml from 0 to 8 h increased the virus yield by threefold. However, this effect was not observed in virus-infected cytoplasts, suggesting that the host-cell nucleus plays a crucial role in the maturation and production of infectious progeny virus. The increase in virus yield might be due to the increased pools of viral precursors caused by the treatment with rifampin."

    "input": "Infection of secondary mouse fibroblast cultures with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) led to the production of viral antigens in the absence of detectable virus replication. Antigen production was not dependent on viral DNA synthesis since it was not inhibited by cytosine arabinoside. Beginning at 15 days post-infection, viral-specific antigens were no longer observable in infected cultures, but could be induced by iododeoxyuridine (IUDR) treatment. Such cultures carry HCMV genetic information in a latent, unexpressed, state. Fusion of latently-infected mouse cells with human fibroblasts also induced viral-specific antigens, but no detectable virus replication, in the resulting heterokaryons. However, upon IUDR treatment of heterokaryons, or of the mouse cells prior to fusion, antigens characteristic of the late stages of virus replication appeared, and infectious CMV could be detected. Thus, it appears that the non-permissive (mouse) cell genome is dominant, and continues to regulate viral gene expression in heterokaryons formed with permissive (human) cells.",

    "input": "Moderate amounts of viral inhibitor were produced by mouse embryo (ME) cultures infected with two strains of plaque-purified murine cytomegalovirus (MCV). This inhibitor was shown to be interferon, based on the possession of similar properties. The growth studies of MCV in ME cells showed that interferon was produced as early as 4 h after infection, infectious virus was produced between 12 to 16 h, and cytopathic effect was produced between 16 to 18 h. Since MCV-induced interferon production and the subsequent development of antiviral state occurred early, the long eclipse period may be due to an interferon-mediated delay of virus replication. Pretreatment of ME cells with varying concentrations of interferon before infection with MCV did not result in increased interferon production, but at high pretreatment doses a slight inhibitory effect on interferon production was observed. In vitro sensitivity studies showed that small doses of MCV were highly sensitive to the antiviral action of interferon, but higher viral doses proved to be markedly resistant. Although the available evidence does not permit a definitive interpretation of the mechanism by which MCV may show differing sensitivities to interferon action, the presence of a small interferon-resistant fraction of virus-infected cells may account for the observations.",

    "input": "Studies performed in the CSV subline of mouse L-cells suggest that activated endogenous and/or exogenous viral infection might be the factor that modifies the cell surface and, in consequence, the sensitivity of the cell to the cell-growth inhibitory action of interferon. In contrast with the parental L-cells, the CSV subline obtained by prolonged passage of L-cells in the presence of interferon shows an altered electron microscopic morphology, absence of C type particles and a decreased agglutinability with Concanavalin A. It is resistant to the cell-growth inhibitory effect of interferon but retains the sensitivity toward its antiviral effect. However, the sensitivity of the CSV subline toward the cell-growth inhibitory effect of interferon increased significantly after treatment with 5-iododexyuridine, infection with the Harvey strain of mouse sarcoma virus and/or prolonged passages in vitro. In this respect, the CSV subline resembles the primary mouse embryonic cells. Since sensitivity of CSV cells increased also after treatment with cyclic 3'-5' adenosine monophosphate and/or prostaglandin E2, it is possible that the cell-growth inhibitory effect of interferon is mediated through the \"second messenger\" system.",
    "output": "The sensitivity of the CSV subline toward the cell-growth inhibitory effect of interferon increases significantly after treatment with 5-iododexyuridine, infection with the Harvey strain of mouse sarcoma virus, and/or prolonged passages in vitro.

    "instruction": "What was the ratio of net dietary protein to total metabolizable energy in the low-protein diet given to the rats?",
    "input": "I. In three separate experiments, four groups of five to eight young male rats were fed either (i) a high-protein diet, for which the net dietary protein:total metabolizable energy ratio (NDp:E) was 0-1 (HP diet); or (ii) a low-protein diet, for which NDp:E was 0-04 (LP diet). In both these groups, food intake was ad lib. In group (iii) the HP diet was given in an amount approximately equal to that taken by the LP group fed ad lib. (HP-restricted). In group (iv) rats were fasted for 48 h after receiving the HP diet (HP-fasted). Each experiment lasted 4 weeks. 2. In the LP and HP-restricted groups, food intake was about 50% of that of the HP rats, while body-weight, after 4 weeks on diet was about 35% and 55% of that of HP rats, for LP and HP-restricted respectively. Both groups of malnourished rats gained some weight during the experiment. 3. Measurements of oral glucose tolerance and plasma insulin levels were made in the fourth week. LP and HP-restricted rats both showed low fasting insulin levels and low insulin to glucose ratios during the glucose tolerance tests; the LP rats were more seriously affected. 4. At the end of the fourth week the rats were killed and blood, liver and gastrocnemius muscle were analysed. LP rats showed specifically and consistently low values for haemoglobin and plasma protein concentration, and low activities of hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3-1-3-9) and of alanine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.2) in liver and muscle. The activity of hepatic aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1) was, if anything, increased. The plasma amino acid concentrations and ratios showed a specific fall in branched-chain amino acids. Liver fat concentration was consistently elevated. The HP-restricted rats had normal values for haemoglobin, plasma protein andliver fat, and near-normal values for plasma amino acids. Hepatic alanine aminotransferase showed increased activity compared with HP rats, but muscle alanine aminotransferase showed reduced activity. The HP-fasted rats had increased haemoglobin, plasma protein and liver fat concentration, and very low liver glycogen concentrations. Hepatic alanine aminotransferase activity was elevated. Plasma alanine concentration was specifically reduced. 5. The results are consistent with suppression of gluconeogenesis, liver dysfunction and essential amino acid deprivation in LP rats. These biochemical changes found in rats on a low intake of a diet of low protein and high carbohydrate value are similar to those found in kwashiorkor. An equally low intake of a diet of good protein value (HP-restricted) led to marginally better growth, accompanied by biochemical signs of increased gluconeogenesis, analogous to those reported for nutritional marasmus. This nutritional state was not biochemically identical with that of acute fasting. 6. The results are discussed in terms of the consistency of the rat model, and its contribution to understanding biochemical changes found in infant malnutrition.",

Body composition and nitrogen of various tissues were determined. In experiment 1, feeding protein conserved tissue and body nitrogen as long as sufficient adipose stores were maintained, but thereafter had no advantage over lower protein intakes supplemented with carbohydrate. In experiment 2, all rats gained weight in proportion to energy intake. Protein level was protective of carcass nitrogen, water and liver nitrogen in both the short- and long-term at the 80% and 90% level of energy intake. Energy intake was more important than protein in conserving muscle nitrogen. Effects of energy and protein restriction are complex and dependent upon the total amount of protein and energy provided, body reserves and duration of restriction.",

However, when adipose stores were depleted, there was no advantage of protein intake over lower protein intakes supplemented with carbohydrate. In other words, protein alone was effective in conserving tissue and body nitrogen only when the rats had enough energy reserves, but when those reserves were depleted, the combination of protein and carbohydrate was more beneficial. In experiment 2, protein level was protective of carcass nitrogen, water, and liver nitrogen at both the short- and long-term, but energy intake was more important than protein in conserving muscle nitrogen."

    "input": "Two groups of rats were provided simultaneously with a commercial stock diet for a period of 7 days. One group was fed ad libitum (control), and the other was restricted to one-fourth of the daily intake of control animals (semistarved). Body weight declined significantly in semistarved rats whereas body weight of controls increased over the 7-day period. The following were determined in vitro on mitochondria isolated from liver, kidney, and heart tissues of both groups: substrate-stimulated and DNP-uncoupled respiratory rates; specific acivities of the Krebs cycle dehydrogenases, and cytochrome c oxidase. Degradative effects of reduced food intake on mitochondrial function were observed. Uncoupled respiratory rates of liver and kidney mitochondria (using succinate as substrate) and heart mitochondria (using alpha-ketoglutarate and pyruvate) were lower. Also lower were activities of isocitrate dehydrogenase, NADP: isocitrate dehydrogenases, transhydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, and cytochrome c oxidase of heart mitochondria, transhdrogenase of liver mitochondria, and isocitrate dehydrogenase and transhydrogenase of kidney mitochondria. Such decreases in enzyme activities under conditions of dietary protein deficiency might have their basis in breakdown rates exceeding synthesis rates or result from partial inactivation of existing enzyme protein. Thus, there is evidence that responses to semistarvation of such parameters of mitochondrial function may differ among various tissues. In addition, liver and kidney citrate levels were lower and heart citrate level higher with semistarvation.",
    "output": "The body weight of the semistarved rats decreased significantly over the 7-day period, while the body weight of the control rats increased. This change in body weight suggests that the semistarved rats were not receiving adequate nutrition, leading to a state of semistarvation.\n\nIn terms of mitochondrial function, the semistarvation led to decreased uncoupled respiratory rates and lower activities of several enzymes in the mitochondria of liver, kidney, and heart tissues. For instance, isocitrate dehydrogenase, NADP: isocitrate dehydrogenases, transhydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, and cytochrome c oxidase were lower in heart mitochondria, while transhydrogenase was lower in liver mitochondria, and isocitrate dehydrogenase and transhydrogenase were lower in kidney mitochondria.\n\nAdditionally, liver and kidney citrate levels were lower, and heart citrate level was higher with semistarvation. These changes in mitochondrial function and citrate levels may be due to breakdown rates exceeding synthesis rates or partial inactivation of existing enzyme protein.\n\nOverall, these findings suggest that semistarvation affects the body weight and mitochondrial function differently among various tissues, with potential implications for overall metabolic homeostasis."

When the wet and dry weights and the water content of the granuloma are expressed in absolute values they show a substantial drop when the protein intake is low or excessive. If however the wet weight of the granuloma is expressed per 100 g of body weight, the differences become no longer significant, hence the importance of the nutritional state of the animal at the time of investigation. Using this test of the anti-inflammatory action of substances, it is necessary to differenciate between actual anti-inflammatory action and direct or secondary effects of the substance on the growth and behaviour of the animal. The levels of mucopolysaccharide drop in rats fed on hypo or hyper-proteinic diets, this would seem to be a sign of the decrease in the intensity of the anti-inflammatory response. What is more, the collagen itself undergoes modifications; there is a shift towards greater solubility of the fractions which would seem to indicate that a drop or a increase in the protein intake brings about a change in the processes of reticulation and maturation of the collagen; several hypothesis can be put forward to explain this phenomenon.",

The diets were given either continuously for 1 month or for 15 days after a protein-free diet. Both diets 1 and 2 permitted good growth of rats and relatively stable microsomal protein content. Protein depletion decreased the total proteins, total phospholipids, and cytochrome P-450 content, and it strongly increased UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity in rat-liver microsomes. Repletion with diet 1 restored those values, to the level found in control rats. However, diet 2, given continuously induced an increase in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity and in the cytochrome P-450 concentration. Since high UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity was related to lessened amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids in the diet, we discuss the possible effect of methionine and cystine on the regulation of glucuronoconjugation in relation to sulfoconjugation.",
    "output": "In the context provided, when rats were given diet 2 continuously, the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity in rat-liver microsomes increased. This increase was not observed when the rats were given diet 1, a balanced diet, or when diet 2 was given for a shorter period. The increased UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity was related to lessened amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids, specifically methionine and cystine, in diet 2.

The effects of meal-feeding on in vitro and in vivo rates of fatty acid synthesis in adipose tissue as well as the amounts of glycogen deposited in the adipose tissue were measured. During the first 10 days of meal-feeding, the lipogenic enzyme activities were actually decreased or unchanged in the meal-fed rats but during this time the in vitro and in vivo rates of fatty acid synthesis were progressively increased in the meal-fed rats. Glycogen levels in the adipose tissue of meal-fed rats were greater than the levels in the nibblers. The initial hyperlipogenesis observed in the meal-fed rat appears to be due to changes in substrate uptake by the adipose tissue and/or to alterations in enzyme activation in the adipose tissue rather than to changes in the quantity of enzyme present in the tissue.",

Among rats given 20% casein, lead retention was inversely related to growth rate. A reduction of dietary protein either had no effect or reduced lead retention. In other experiments lasting 4 days and using 203Pb, given orally or intraperitoneally, the recovery of isotope in the gutfree carcass was unaffected or reduced by a reduction in dietary protein. Blood and liver lead often increased when kidney and carcass lead decreased in response to a reduction of dietary protein. Conflicting observations on the effect of low-protein diets on lead retention may thus be due to opposing effects of low dietary protein and decreases of growth rate and to different responses of different tissues.",

    "input": "Bovine neurohypophyses were fractionated by differential and density gradient ultracentrifugation and the Ca-2+ uptake and ATPase activities in the microsomal, mitochondrial and secretory granule fractions were studied. The microsomal and mitochondrial fractions accumulated Ca-2+ in the presence of ATP. The accumulation by the latter per mg protein was at least twice as large as by the former. This Ca2+ accumulation was accompanied by liberation of inorganic phosphate (Pi). In the presence of sodium azide (2 mM) Ca-2+ uptake and Pi liberation were inhibited in the mitochondrial, but not in the microsomal fraction. Further studies of the microsomal fractions revealed that the ATP-dependent Ca-2+ uptake and Pi liberation activities were temperature and pH-dependent and required Mg-2+. Both activities were stimulated by very low concentrations of Ca-2+ (1-10 muM) and were inhibited by EGTA (2 mM). N-ethylmaleimide (2 mM) inhibited both the Ca-2+ uptake and ATPase activities of the microsomal fraction. These results suggest the presence of a membrane ATPase that is stimulated by both Ca-2+ and Mg-2+. It is suggested that the observed Ca-2+ uptake activities are involved in maintaining a low axoplasmic free Ca-2+ concentration, thus playing an important role in the release mechanism of vasopressin by the neurosecretory terminals.",

    "input": "The K+-stimulated, ouabain-insensitive ATPase activity present in vesicles of microsomal fractions from hog gastric mucosa can be demonstrated in fresh preparations by adding Ca2+ (micron range) to the incubation medium. Ca2+ effect is similar but not additive to the effect of gramicidin or freezing. High Ca2+ concentrations (1 mM) produce an inhibitory effect on the K+-stimulated ATPase activity. This effect is not seen in the presence of gramicidin. Calcium increases the magnitude of ATP-driven H+ uptake in vesicles exposed to K+ for periods of time up to 60 min. At longer times of exposure (120 min) the response does not differ from controls. It is concluded that Ca2+ at low concentrations (micron range) enhances the K+ permeability of the vesicular membrane. At higher concentrations (mM range), Ca2+ becomes inhibitory to the K+ permeability. A role for Ca2+ as a second messenger in stimulus-secretion coupling in the parietal cell is discussed.",

Incorporation of the Ca2+ transport ATPase into phospholipid bilayers of widely different fatty acid composition increases their passive permeability to Ca2+ by several orders of magnitude. Therefore in addition to participating in active Ca2+ transport, the (Mg2+ + Ca2+)-activated ATPase also forms hydrophilic channels across the membrane. The relative insensitivity of the permeability effect of ATPase to changes in the fatty acid composition of the membrane is in accord with the suggestion that the Ca2+ channels arise by protein-protein interaction between four ATPase molecules. The reversible formation of these channels may have physiological significance in the rapid Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during activation of muscle.",

After the complete elimination of the ionophore the passive Ca2+-permeability of the membrane returned to its normal low value, except when the intracellular Ca2+-concentration was higher than 3 mM or the ATP level fell below 100 muM. Within these limits the rate of Ca2+-extrusion was independent of the cellular ATP content but was greatly enhanced by increasing [Ca2+]i and reached a plateau at about 1 mM intracellular Ca2+-concentration. The maximum rate of Ca2+-efflux was about 85 mumol/l of cells per min at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4. The activation energy of active Ca2+-extrusion was found to be 15 200 cal/mol, and the optimum pH in the suspension was 7.7. Ca2+-efflux was not connected with the counter-transport of cations. The Ca2+-pump was not affected by ouabain or oligomycin and only partial inhibition could be achieved by the SH-reagents: ethacrynic acid, N-ethylmaleimide and p-chloromercuribenzoate or with propranolol and ruthenium red. An 80 to 95% inhibition of the active Ca2+-extrusion was brought about by 50-250 muM lanthanum, which in the above concentrations caused no aggregation or haemolysis. The inhibition of the Ca2+-pump by lanthanum was found to be reversible, the site of inhibition being at the external surface of the cell membrane. To examine the energy consumption of the Ca2+-extrusion, ATPase activity was assessed by measuring inorganic phosphate liberation in Ca2+-loaded red cells the metabolism of which was inhibited by iodoacetamide + Na+-tetrathionate.

    "input": "The kinetics of uptake of Ca(2+) by rat heart mitochondria were studied by a spectrophotometric method with Arsenazo III indicator. The exponential rate coefficients measured with or without added phosphate increase with the amount of Ca(2+) added up to about 24mum. Evidence is given that the effect is attributable to a combination of formation of chelates at low concentrations to act as Ca(2+) buffers, with co-transport of substrate to provide more respiratory fuel. The inhibitory effect of Mg(2+) depends on the Ca(2+) concentration, so with a constant [Mg(2+)] the low concentrations of Ca(2+) are most inhibited, and the rate coefficients are still more Ca(2+)-dependent. Ca(2+) uptake is slowed by local anaesthetics such as butacaine and dibucaine, and also by propranolol and palmitoyl-CoA. After an uptake, the release of Ca(2+) was investigated. The spontaneous release involves an initially slow and small appearance of free Ca(2+) and is followed by an auto-accelerated phase. The release is accompanied by a gradual decrease in internal ATP; it is initiated by palmitoyl-CoA (reversed by carnitine), by lysophosphatidylcholine, by Na(+) salts (reversed by oligomycin) and by K(+) salts added to a K(+)-free medium containing valinomycin. The process is probably a response to an increased energy load imposed on the mitochondria by the various conditions, which include the spontaneous action of phospholipase activated by traces of Ca(2+). The problem of how much mitochondrial activity is participating in normal heart Ca(2+) turnover is discussed, and experiments showing only 7-14% exchange of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) occurring in vivo in 10 or 20min are reported.",

In addition it was found that the acceleration was greatest at pH 7.2 and almost negligible at pH 6.0 and pH 7.8. A very marked increase in Ca2+ uptake by cyclic AMP-dependent membrane protein phosphorylation was observed in the presence of boric acid, a reversible inhibitor of Ca2+ uptake. In addition to the microsomal fraction thought to represent mainly fragments of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the effect of protein kinase and cyclic AMP on Ca2+ uptake was investigated in a cardiac sarcolemma-enriched membrane fraction. Ca2+ uptake by sarcolemmal vesicles, unlike Ca2+ uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, was inhibited by low doses of digitoxin. The acceleration of oxalate-promoted Ca2+ uptake by cyclic AMP and soluble cardiac protein kinase, however, was quite similar to what was seen in preparations of fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum, which suggests that it may reflect an acceleration of active Ca2+ transport across the myocardial cell surface membrane.",

    "input": "Two different mechanisms for the active accumulation of Ca2+ by subcellular fractions of human umbilical artery are described. One, located in the mitochondrial fraction, was induced by exogenous ATP or respiratory substrates (ADP and succinate) and was inhibited by azide. The other, located in the microsomal fraction, was induced by ATP and potentiated by oxalate, but not inhibited by azide. Increasing ATP concentrations up to 4-5 mM increased microsomal Ca2+ accumulation, whereas increasing ATP concentration above 2-3 mM caused inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Although changing pH from 7.4 to 7.2 had no effect on mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation, it doubled microsomal uptake. Neither adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate nor guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate in the presence or absence of protein kinase and kinase modulator affected Ca2+ uptake by or phosphorylation of the subcellular fractions. Partially purified protein kinases from umbilical and beef skeletal muscle contained a component(s) distinguishable from the kinase on the basis of its heat stability that enhanced ATP-induced Ca2+ uptake by mitochondrial fractions from the umbilical artery. It is suggested that alterations in Ca2+ sequestration induced by changes in ATP concentration and intracellular pH in mitochondrial and microsomal fractions, respectively, could play a role in the control of arterial patency and closure with changes in PO2.",

If the membranes were prepared in the absence of Ca2+ the Km increased, and an enzyme model with at least four calcium-binding sites accounted for the kinetic change assuming that one calcium-binding site decreased its affinity. Mg2+ or Mg-ATP could not replace Ca2+. Continuous-flow centrifugation involving a shear stress on membranes was necessary to obtain the high affinity ATPase activity. Using ordinary centrifugation the Ca2+-prepared membranes behaved as membranes prepared in the absence of Ca2+. The Ca2+-stimulated ATPase from membranes prepared without Ca2+ showed reduced maximum activity, but dialyzed, membrane-free hemolysates, whether prepared with Ca2+ present or not, recovered the activity when the hemolysate was present during the ATPase assay. It is suggested that the different Ca2+-affinities of the Ca2+-stimulated ATPase correspond to two different states of the calcium-pump.",

    "input": "Calcium ions were shown to be actively accumulated in mitochondrial and microsomal fractions of uterine smooth muscle of rabbit and cattle. In presence of magnesium ions Ca2+ (10-6-10-4 M) activate microsomal ATPase from cattle uterus. The rate of formation and dissociation of the intermediate phosphorylated substance of Mg2+, Ca2+-ATPase was found to be lower in microsomes of smooth muscles than in sarcoplasmic reticulum of sceletal muscles. Serotonine (concentration 10-6 M) increased the dissociation of the intermediate phosphorylated substance from microsomes of uterine smooth muscle and decreased their capacity to bind Ca2+. At the same concentration serotonine inhibited the ATP-dependent accumulation of 45Ca by microsomes of uterine smooth muscle.",
    "output": "Serotonin has an inhibitory effect on the ATP-dependent accumulation of 45Ca by microsomes of uterine smooth muscle. This is due to its ability to decrease the capacity of microsomes to bind Ca2+ and increase the dissociation of the intermediate phosphorylated substance from the microsomes, thereby interfering with the ATPase activity involved in calcium accumulation."

    "input": "ATP and the divalent cations Mg2+ and Ca2+ regulated K+ stimulation of the Ca2+-transport ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. Millimolar concentrations of total ATP increased the K+-stimulated ATPase activity of the Ca2+ pump by two mechanisms. First, ATP chelated free Mg2+ and, at low ionized Mg2+ concentrations, K+ was shown to be a potent activator of ATP hydrolysis. In the absence of K+ ionized Mg2+ activated the enzyme half-maximally at approximately 1 mM, whereas in the presence of K+ the concentration of ionized Mg2+ required for half-maximal activation was reduced at least 20-fold. Second MgATP apparently interacted directly with the enzyme at a low affinity nucleotide site to facilitate K+-stimulation. With a saturating concentration of ionized Mg2+, stimulation by K+ was 2-fold, but only when the MgATP concentration was greater than 2 mM. Hill plots showed that K+ increased the concentration of MgATP required for half-maximal enzymic activation approx. 3-fold. Activation of K+-stimulated ATPase activity by Ca2+ was maximal at an ionized Ca2+ concentration of approx. 1 microM. At very high concentrations of either Ca2+ or Mg2+, basal Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity persisted, but the enzymic response to K+ was completely inhibited. The results provide further evidence that the Ca2+-transport ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum has distinct sites for monovalent cations, which in turn interact allosterically with other regulatory sites on the enzyme.",

With T-typing alone, 22 per cent of the strains showed agglutination patterns implying only one M type each. When considered together, the T-typing and enzyme reactions made it possible to implicate one M type only for each of 45 per cent of the strains. In a further 34 per cent of the strains, the possible M type of each strain was restricted to four types. However, these findings were hampered by the fact that the T patterns of a number of more seldom met group A streptococci have not been investigated adequately.",

One of the antigens showed reaction of identity with a preparation of teichoic acid from S. aureus. Using this reference system, cross-reactions between the S. aureus reference strain and S. aureus strains from the four phage groups as well as 15 other bacterial species, were studied by various quantitative immunoelectrophoretic methods. The S. aureus antigens from the four phage groups showed almost 100% cross-reactivity for all antigens, while antigens from nine other bacterial species cross-reacted to varying degrees with one to four S. aureus antigens.

The spore antigens had corresponding somatic antigens; the type-specific somatic antigens were designated I, II, III, and the shared somatic antigen IV. The flagellar antigens were found to be type specific and were designated 1, 2 and 3; no common flagellar antigen was detected. The results of precipitation tests with spore extracts depended on the method of testing. By a capillary-tube ring method there were cross reactions among the three types of C. sporogenes, whilst by immunodiffusion in agar layers the reactions were generally type specific. In a disintegrated spore extract, two non-protein antigenic components, possibly polysaccharide, were detected by means of immunoelectrophoresis. This extract showed cross reaction with antisera to strains of all types of all types of C. sporogenes by the ring test and by immunodiffusion.",

Out of 416 Salmonella bacteria tested the reagents correctly identified all 24 serogroup A strains, 119 serogroup B strains and 39 serogroup D strains. Unexpected agglutination was registered with two of 144 strains belonging to serogroup C 2 with reagent containing antiserum against synthetic O antigen 4. No agglutination occurred when 24 non-Salmonella bacterial strains were tested. Approximately 10(8)bacteria were required for positive co-agglutination. As compared to standard slide agglutination with conventional anti-Salmonella O factor sera, the co-agglutination metod was favourable in that the reactions were stronger, although the concentration of antiserum used was from 20 to 200 times lower. The co-agglutination method could also be used for detection of soluble antigens in the form of lipopolysaccharides from Salmonella bacteria in concentrations of 1 microgram/ml.

Five of the six women with liver cell adenoma and two of the six with focal nodular hyperplasia had taken orally active contraceptive hormones. These few cases reflect a similar impression gained from a critical analysis of the literature, namely, that focal nodular hyperplasia may be unrelated to the oral administration of contraceptive hormones, whereas the increase in liver cell adenoma reported in recent years is probably related to such therapy. Two women with liver cell adenomas were asymptomatic six and four years after incomplete resection of the tumor.

The causative agent may be the steroidal oral contraceptives. Two lesions are recognized: focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatic adenoma. This paper concentrates on focal nodular hyperplasia, with two cases added to the four previously described cases. It is postulated that the estrogen component causes vascular lesions characterized by myointimal hyperplasia and thrombosis, leading to infarct, necrosis, and subsequent nodular hepatic regeneration. The clinical feature highlighted is the long history of gastrointestinal disturbance associated with negative gastrointestinal investigation with the possible exception of cholelithiasis. It is suggested that gray-scale ultrasonography is an effective screening method that also aids in a definitive diagnosis. As these tumors are often incidental findings it is emphasized that the liver should always be inspected at laparoscopy. Ultimately, diagnosis by biopsy or excision is essential as it may well be possible to treat cases of focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver conservatively, once oral contraceptives have been discontinued.",

Twenty one cases have already been reported in the literature. The aetiological role of contraceptives in the development of generally benign (approximately 200 published cases) and sometime malignant hepatic lesions, has not been definitely proven. The regression of certain benign tumours when contraceptives are stopped is the essential argument. In some patients, the association of benign lesions and of hepatic carcinoma suggests a single pathogenesis. The early recognition of such lesions justifies their being sought routinely in patients taking oral contraceptives (palpation of the liver, questioning concerning pain in the hepatic region). A national register will be required in order to determine their exact prevalence.",

Nineteen of the tumors were malignant and, to date, 12 of those patients have died of their disease. Since hepatomas are much more common than benign liver tumors, one must be even more circumspect in indicting steroids in their causation. In this group of women none had cirrhosis, whereas in the general population cirrhosis is a very common precedent lesion.

    "input": "Considered from the point of view of clinical practice, the treatment of chronic headache may be either symptomatic and etiological or physiopathological. Progress in symptomatic treatment depends first on the reasonable and graduated use of pure analgesics, looking out for the toxic side effects of the usual drugs and then the fairly definite efficacy of certain psychotropic drugs. The discovery of an etiology gives a specific dimension to the treatment: either anti-cerebral oedema drugs with above all tetracosactide, a diagnostic test of cerebral tumours, or antidepressor or tranquillizer drugs, depending on the variety of disturbance to be corrected. An attack of migraine always benefits from ergotamine used occasionally and in limited dosage (not more than 6 mg daily or 10 mg per week). For the basic treatment the drugs act mainly peripherally and fairly regularly in the following order: methysergide, beta-blockaders, pizotifene, cyproheptadine, oxetorone.

    "instruction": "What happens to the tissue and plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressor drugs after stopping treatment?",
    "input": "The neuroleptics are characterised by the large number of pharmacological effects they develop. When they are associated with other substances, it is frequent for the latter to have with neuroleptics one or several common sites of action. At this level, they develop phenomena of drug interaction, for example, synergy with depressors of the central nervous system or, in the periphery, with alpha-adrenolytic or parasympatholytic drugs. This type of interaction is used in anesthesia to obtain more intense effects with lesser doses of each component and also avoid the toxic effects of efficacious doses of general anesthetics used alone. However, although certain interactions are useful, others may prove harmful. This is in particular the case where neuroleptic drugs are administered after ingestion of alcohol. Various mechanisms, central and peripheral, explain the marked depression of the central nervous system which results. Potentialisation of the effects of tricyclic antidepressor drugs by neuroleptics raises a difficult problem for the anesthetist, the elimination of tricyclic antidepressor drugs is slow and requires several weeks after stopping treatment. During this period, the tissue and plasma concentrations become reduced gradually. They are pharmacologically insufficient, but are potentialised by injection of neuroleptic drugs, and may become active again, and even toxic. It seems to us advisable to avoid the use of neuroleptic drugs in patients treated with tricyclic antidepressor drugs and, if necessary, to use another method of anesthesia.",
    "output": "After stopping treatment with tricyclic antidepressant drugs, the tissue and plasma concentrations gradually decrease over several weeks. However, due to the slow elimination of these drugs from the body, even though the concentrations may become pharmacologically insufficient, they can still be potentially activated or even become toxic again when neuroleptic drugs are administered. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid the use of neuroleptic drugs in patients treated with tricyclic antidepressants, or use another method of anesthesia to avoid potential toxicity."

    "instruction": "What is one potential benefit of understanding the pharmacology of antihypertensive drugs, according to the context?",
    "input": "One major problem in the management of hypertensive patients is their lack of compliance with therapeutic regimens. Some of the problem with compliance is due to side effects of the drugs being used. Additionally, drug resistance may be related to interactions of antihypertensive drugs with other prescription and nonprescription drugs. By classifying drugs into common modes of action, common side effects can be predicted. However, each drug has its own spectrum of other side effects which can be dose-limiting. Most of the side effects are extensions of the pharmacologic actions of these drugs, and only relatively rarely is an allergic reaction a problem. Drug interactions can be important in explaining some side effects or drug resistance. A knowledge of the pharmacology of the antihypertensive drugs allows the physician to predict, in many cases, the possibility of an interaction and, indeed, can allow the use of interactions to advantage as with combinations of vasodilators and beta adrenergic blocking drugs. Until such time as the perfect antihypertensive drug is discovered, most patients can be managed satisfactorily with minimal side effects by judicious combination of available drugs and avoiding drugs which interact to cause more side effects or decrease the antihypertensive effects.",

    "instruction": "What is the potential benefit of serum level monitoring in the treatment of epilepsy?",
    "input": "The drug treatment of epilepsy poses considerable problems, including the high prevalence and early age of onset of seizures, the relatively poor prognosis in many patients, prolonged polypharmacy, chronic toxicity, and uncertainty of the relative efficacy of individual drugs. The application of recent knowledge of the clinical pharmacology of the major anticonvulsants offers a partial solution to several of these problems. Although there is no therapeutic range for any drug applicable to all patients, a more simple rational and effective approach to treatment is possible with the guidance of serum level monitoring. In new referrals, there is considerable potential for monotherapy, and the avoidance of polypharmacy and chronic toxicity. Reduction in polypharmacy in chronic patients is more difficult, but in many can be achieved with reduction in toxicity, and sometimes improved seizure control. Further studies will provide a clearer picture of the limits to modern anticonvulsant therapy, the relative efficacy of individual drugs, and the potential for improved long-term prognosis.",
    "output": "The potential benefit of serum level monitoring in the treatment of epilepsy is that it offers a more rational and effective approach to treatment. It can help guide the selection of the most appropriate drug and dosage for an individual patient, reducing the likelihood of prolonged polypharmacy, chronic toxicity, and uncertainty of drug efficacy. In new referrals, it can facilitate monotherapy and avoid the need for polypharmacy and chronic toxicity. In chronic patients, it can help reduce polypharmacy, improve seizure control, and reduce toxicity. However, it's important to note that while serum level monitoring can be helpful, it does not provide a therapeutic range applicable to all patients, and further studies are needed to clarify the limits of modern anticonvulsant therapy and the potential for improved long-term prognosis."

    "input": "The prescribing of anxiolytics is often a hit-and-miss process. Current knowledge is examined to encourage a more rational use of such drugs. Because the common symptoms occur in a great array of illnesses, diagnosis is of first importance. For the transient situational disturbance drugs may be unnecessary or may be used merely for a day or two. If the anxiety state persists for a month or so the illness might be termed an anxiety neurosis and if there is no accompanying depression, a short course of benzodiazepine may be of value. With depression present to more than a mild degree as part of the neurosis the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin usually achieves better results than a benzodiazepine. Imipramine can be helpful for the phobic anxiety syndrome and monoamine-oxidase inhibitors can be of separate utility. If the anxiety and depression occur in the context of alcoholism, thioridazine and amitriptyline have certain advantages. There is very little place for phenothiazines or other antipsychotic agents in low doses in the therapy of anxiety except for thioridazine in the above indication.",
    "output": "For anxiety neurosis with accompanying depression of more than a mild degree, the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin is usually recommended. This is because it tends to achieve better results compared to a benzodiazepine in such cases. However, it's important to note that individual responses to medication can vary, and the final decision should be made by a healthcare professional based on the patient's specific condition and circumstances."

Most extensive controlled studies done until now showed no significant differences among neuroloptics in their therapeutic efficacy. The hypothesis that these drugs have specific and selective actions therfore cannot be accepted. In the single patient it seems more rational to choose the right dosage schedule instead of the \"right drug\". Though the study of the metabolism of these drugs remains the most interesting approach to the problem of the individualization of the therapy., the results of these studies have until now been disappointing e.g. plasma levels of chlorpromazine correlated weakly with clinical improvement. In clinical practice an important element in the process of choosing is still the incidence of side effects and in fact at the moment \"the drug of choice\" can only be the drug best tolerated by the patient.",
    "output": "In clinical practice, the main factor in determining \"the drug of choice\" for a patient, particularly in the treatment of schizophrenia, is the drug's tolerance by the patient. Since extensive controlled studies have shown no significant differences among neuroleptics in their therapeutic efficacy, the choice of drug often depends on the patient's response to side effects. This approach is more rational as it prioritizes the patient's comfort and well-being during treatment. However, the study of drug metabolism remains an interesting approach to individualizing therapy, but the results have been disappointing so far, especially in terms of correlating plasma levels with clinical improvement."

    "input": "Rat liver microsomes contain a phenobarbital inducible, NADPH dependent, reductive glycosidase capable of cleaving several anthracycline antibiotics, including adriamycin and daunorubicin, to deoxyaglycone products. The pH optimum for the reaction ranges from 7 to 7.4, and no metal requirements are noted. Molecular oxygen reversibly inhibits the microsomal enzyme greater than 95% at 20% oxygen partial pressure. Carbon monoxide, SKF 525A and sulfhydryl reagents are not inhibitory to the reaction, but the enzyme is sensitive to Cu++ and Zn++. Since the intact glycoside is necessary for conversion to the deoxyaglycone and a possible intermediate hydroxylated aglycone is not reduced to the deoxyaglycone, a concerted reaction mechanism is proposed. The reductive glycosidase activity is also present in rat brain, kidney and other tissues. Sensitivity of this enzyme to molecular oxygen suggests a possible regulatory role for the enzyme in vivo.",
    "output": "Molecular oxygen at 20% partial pressure significantly and reversibly inhibits the microsomal enzyme responsible for cleaving anthracycline antibiotics in rat liver microsomes. This inhibition is more than 95%. This suggests a potential regulatory role for this enzyme in vivo due to its sensitivity to oxygen."

Tetrabutylammonium bromide, a lipophilic probe capable of selectively inhibiting phosphorylating oxidation or uncoupling oxidation from phosphorylation, was used to detect subtle alterations in lipophilicity characteristics of the organelles and it was concluded that mitochondria from pre-hyperplastic, hyperplastic, and neoplastic tissues had a higher than normal degree of membrane lipophilicity at specific functional sites. Control of respiration by ADP was markedly augmented in all experimental groups; this behavior, plus depressed sensitivity to swelling agents and energized contraction, were similar in mitochondria from hepatomas and from 3-day regenerating livers. These mitochondrial functions were even more pronounced, however, in cells in pre-hyperplastic states (6 and 16 h subsequent to partial hepatectomy). Many forms of liver damage result in mitochondrial alterations which elevate the capacity for oxidative phosphorylation. Such changes associated with induction of azo dye oncogenesis are mimicked by the degree of hyperplasia in the tissue following the first mitotic wave of regeneration; implications relevant to hepatocarcinogenesis are discussed.",

    "input": "The effects on cellular structures of products of peroxidation of rat liver microsomal lipids were investigated. A system containing actively peroxidizing liver microsomal fraction was separated from a revealing or target system by a dialysis membrane. The target system, contained in the dialysis tube, consisted of either intact cells (erythrocytes) or subcellular fractions (liver microsomal fraction). When liver microsomal fractions were incubated with NADPH (or an NADPH-generating system), lipid peroxidation, as measured by the amount of malonaldehyde formed, occurred very rapidly. The malon-aldehyde concentration tended to equilibrate across the dialysis membrane. When the target system consisted of erythrocytes, haemolysis occurred abruptly after a lag phase. The lysis was greatly accelerated when erythrocytes from vitamin E-deficient rats were used, but no haemolysis was observed when erythrocytes from vitamin E-treated rats were used. When, in the same system, freshly prepared liver microsomal fractions were exposed to diffusible factors produced by lipid peroxidation, the glucose 6-phosphatase activity markedly decreased. A similar decrease in glucose 6-phosphatase activity, as well as a smaller but significant decrease in cytochrome P-450, was observed when the target microsomal fractions were exposed to diffusible factors derived from the peroxidation of liver microsomal lipids in a separate preincubation step. These and additional experiments indicated that the toxicological activity is relatively stable. Experiments in which the hepatic microsomal fractions destined for lipid peroxidation contained radioactively labelled arachidonic acid, previously incorporated into the membranes, showed that part of the radioactivity released from the microsomal fraction into the incubation medium entered the dialysis tube and was recovered bound to the constituents of the microsomal fractions of the target system. These results indicate that during the course of the peroxidation of liver microsomal lipids toxic products are formed that are able to induce pathological effects at distant loci.",
    "output": "In the context provided, it is stated that when freshly prepared liver microsomal fractions were exposed to diffusible factors produced by lipid peroxidation, the activity of glucose 6-phosphatase significantly decreased. This suggests that the factors derived from lipid peroxidation may have a negative impact or inhibitory effect on the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase in liver microsomes. However, it's important to note that this is a result observed in the specific experimental conditions described, and further research would be needed to confirm and understand the underlying mechanisms."

Hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase activity was increased fourfold by tyrosine, twofold by tetracycline, 2.5-fold by cortisone 21-acetate and ninefold by a combination of tyrosine and cortisol administered intraperitoneally to rats. 3. Radioimmunoassay with 14C-labelled tyrosine aminotransferase, in conjunction with rabbit antiserum against the enzyme, revealed that cortisol stimulates the synthesis of the enzyme de novo, but that tetracycline has no such effect. 4. Incubation of rat liver homogenates with purified tyrosine aminotransferase in vitro leads to a rapid inactivation of the enzyme, which tetracycline partially inhibits. 5. The inactivation is brought about by intact lysosomes, and the addition of 10mM-cysteine increases the rate of enzyme inactivation, which is further markedly increased by 10mM-Mg2+ and 10mM-ATP. Here again tetracycline partially inhibits the decay rate, leading to the inference that the increase of tyrosine aminotransferase activity in vivo by tetracycline is brought about by the latter inhibiting the lysosomal catheptic action.",
    "output": "The context provided suggests that 10mM-cysteine increases the rate of tyrosine aminotransferase inactivation. This is inferred from the statement that incubation of rat liver homogenates with purified tyrosine aminotransferase in vitro leads to a rapid inactivation of the enzyme, and the addition of 10mM-cysteine increases this rate.

    "input": "1. Microsomal membranes from rat liver were incubated with ATP, CoA, Mg2+, [14C]palmitate, F- and sn-glycerol 3-phosphate in order to label them with [14C]phosphatidate. These membranes were isolated and used in a second incubation in which [3H]CTP was present, and the simultaneous synthesis of [14C]diacylglycerol and [3H]CDP-diacylglycerol was measured. 2. The addition of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, which had been partially purified from the particle-free supernatant, supplemented the activity of the endogenous phosphohydrolase, but it did not alter the rate of CDP-diacylglycerol formation. 3. Adding EDTA inhibited phosphatidate cytidylyl-transferase activity and stimulated the activity of the phosphohydrolases by removing excess of Mg2+. 4. Increasing the concentration of Mg2+, norfenfluramine or chlorpromazine in the assay system stimulated cytidylyltransferase activity, but decreased the activities of both phosphohydrolases. 5. The mechanism for the stimulation of cytidylyl=transferase activity by the cationic drugs and Mg2+ was investigated with emulsions of phosphatidate and the microsomal fraction of rat liver. 6. There was a threshold concentration of about 5mM-MgCl2 below which no cytidylyltransferase activity was detected in the presence or absence of norfenfluramine. Just above this threshold concentration norfenfluramine stimulated cytidylyltransferase activity, but this stimulation disappeared as the Mg2+ concentration was raised to its optimum of 20mM. Norfenfluramine therefore partially replaced the bivalent-cation requirement. 7. At 30 mM-MgCl2 amphiphilic cationic drugs inhibited cytidylyltransferase activity at relatively high concentrations in a non-competitive manner with respect to phosphatidate. 8. The implications of these results are discussed with respect to the regulation of the synthesis of the acidic phospholipids compared with the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and triacylglycerol.",
    "output": "The addition of EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) inhibited the activity of phosphatidate cytidylyl-transferase while stimulating the activity of phosphohydrolases. This is due to the fact that EDTA removes excess Mg2+, which is required for the activity of phosphatidate cytidylyl-transferase. Conversely, increasing the concentration of Mg2+ stimulates cytidylyltransferase activity but decreases the activities of both phosphohydrolases. The cationic drugs, such as norfenfluramine and chlorpromazine, can partially replace the bivalent-cation requirement for cytidylyltransferase activity but at higher concentrations, they inhibit cytidylyltransferase activity in a non-competitive manner with respect to phosphatidate."

    "instruction": "What is the effect of ethanol on cellular glucuronide formation in isolated liver cells?",
    "input": "In rat liver cells isolated by perfusion in the perfusion in the presence of collagenase, the major portion of cytochrome P-450 is present in the oxidized, nonsubstrate-bound, low spin state. Drug addition to a suspension of liver cells results in the rapid formation of the cytochrome P-450 (Fe3+)-substrate complex which in turn is followed by the appearance of other species with different spectral characteristics before steady state drug monooxygenation is achieved. Cytochrome P-450-linked metabolism of various tested drugs and carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons by isolated rat liver cells is as fast, or faster, as with rat liver microsomes supplemented with a NADPH generating system. Both experimental models respond similarily to phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene pretreatment of the animals and to various of the wellknown inhibitors of drug metabolism. Except with liver cells isolated from fasted, phenobarbital-treated rats, generation of cytosolic NADPH seems sufficient to support optimal drug metabolism even in the absence of added substrates of intermediary metabolism. In isolated liver cells oxidized drug metabolites undergo subsequent metabolic conversion, most often to form the corresponding glucuronides and sulphates. These are readily excreted, whereas non-conjugated products, e.g. free phenols, tend to accumulate intracellularly. Cellular glucuronide formation is strongly inhibited by ethanol-presumably due to an unfavorable effect of the increased NADH/NAD+ ratio on the synthesis of uridine-5'-diphosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA). In contrast, low concentrations of ethanol have no, or only a slight stimulatory effect on the cytochrome P-450-linked step of drug metabolism and there are indications that the oxidation of low concentrations of ethanol is in fact stimulated by a facilitated reoxidation of cytosolic NADH occuring during drug monooxygenation.",
    "output": "The effect of ethanol on cellular glucuronide formation in isolated liver cells is inhibitory. This inhibition is presumed to be due to an unfavorable effect of the increased NADH/NAD+ ratio on the synthesis of uridine-5'-diphosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA), a crucial component in the process of glucuronide formation."

After 6 weeks of feeding, some key enzymes of the tryptophan and nicotinic acid-NAD pathway, liver nicotinamide nucleotide concentration, and urinary metabolites of tryptophan and nicotinic acid were studied. With an increase in diet restriction, liver tryptophan oxygenase (EC 1.13.1.12) activity increased. Quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.a) activity, on the other hand, was found to decrease with moderate diet restriction up to 50% restriction, but increased again with more severe diet restriction in rats fed 25% of ad libitum intake. Liver nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.11) activity was also observed to decrease with moderate diet restriction and did not further change when the restriction was severe while picolinate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.45) activity increased significantly only in severe diet restriction. In rats fed 25% of ad libitum intake, urinary quinolinic acid excretion was low whereas N'-methylnicotinamide excretion was elevated. Alterations in the enzyme activities accompanied by changes in the levels of urinary metabolites, observed in the present study, suggest that the potential efficiency of conversion of tryptophan to nicotinamide nucleotides is not constant and is influenced by dietary intake.",

This increase was accompanied by a decrease in the free [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio calculated from concentrations of substrates assumed to be in near-equilibrium with isocitrate dehydrogenase. After pretreatment with 6-aminonicotinamide the [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio also declined. Reduction of NADP+ during mixed-function oxidation may be explained by inhibition of of one or more NADPH-generating enzymes. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and \"malic\" enzyme, partially purified from livers of phenobarbital-treated rats, were inhibited by ATP and ADP. Inhibitor constants of ATP for the four dehydrogenases varied considerably, ranging from 9 micrometer for \"malic\" enzyme to 1.85 mM for glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. NADPH-cytochrome c reductase was also inhibited by ATP (Ki 2.8 mM) and by ADP (Ki 0.9 mM), but not by AMP. Concentrations of ATP and ADP that inhibited glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and the reductase were comparable with concentrations in the intact liver. Thus agents that lower intracellular ATP may accelerate rates of mixed-function oxidation by a concerted mechanism involving deinhibition of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and one or more NADPH-generating enzymes.",

The reductions, however, were generally modest; not uniform for all the enzymes assayed; and correlated poorly with histologic necrosis and standard liver function tests. It is concluded that in acute liver disease changes in the hepatic in vitro drug metabolizing enzyme capacity may not be closely related to cellular necrosis, per se, and the degree of change in enzyme activities will vary from one enzyme system to another. These findings may explain, in part, the often inconsistent alterations in the disposition and elimination of drugs described in associated liver disease.",

The purified enzyme contains no flavin and has an absolute requirement for FAD, with Km values around 4 muM. The pH optimum of the enzyme appears to be between 6.5 and 7; the optimum is difficult to establish because of nonenzymatic reduction of DCIP at the lower pH values. Potassium cyanide stimulates the DCIP reductase activity about 2-fold, but has no effect on ferricyanide reductase. The enzyme exhibits hyperbolic kinetics with respect to NADH concentration in both the ferricyanide and DCIP reductase assays, but cooperatively is seen in the menadione reductase reaction. NAD+ is an effective competitive inhibitor of the reaction (Ki congruent to 20 muM); in the presence of NAD+, the NADH saturation curve becomes cooperative, even in the DCIP reductase assay. Many adenine containing nucleotides are competitive inhibitors of the enzyme. The apparent Ki values for these nucleotides as inhibitors of the purified enzyme, the membrane-bound NADH dehydrogenase, and the NADH oxidase are equivalent. An examination of inhibitory effects of a series of adenine nucleotides suggests that the inhibitors act as analogues of NAD+, which is the true physiological inhibitor. The results suggest that the enzyme in situ is always partially inhibited by the levels of NAD- in the E coli cell, and thus behaves in a cooperative fashion to changes in the NAD+/NADH ratio. An antibody has been elicited against the purified NADH dehydrogenase. Immunodiffusion and crossed immunoelectrophoresis show that the antibody is directed principally against the NADH dehydrogenase, with some activity against minor contaminants in the purified preparation. The antibody inhibits NADH dehydrogenase activity 50% at saturating levels. When this antibody preparation is used to examine solubilized membrane preparations, two major immunoprecipitates are found. A parallel inhibition of the membrane-bound NADH dehydrogenase and NADH oxidase activities is seen, supporting the hypothesis that the purified enzyme is indeed a component of the respiratory chain-dependent NADH oxidase pathway.",

    "input": "1. Oxidation of NADPH by various acceptors catalyzed by submitochondrial particles and a partially purified NADH dehydrogenase from beef heart was investigated. Submitochondrial particles devoid of nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase activity catalyze an oxidation of NADPH by oxygen. The partially purified NADH dehydrogenase prepared from these particles catalyzes an oxidation of NADPH by acetylpyridine-NAD. In both cases the rates of oxidation are about two orders of magnitude lower than those obtained with NADH as electron donor. 2. The kinetic characteristics of the NADPH oxidase reaction and reduction of acetylpyridine-NAD by NADPH are similar with regard to pH dependences and affinities for NADPH, indicating that both reactions involve the same binding site for NADPH. The binding of NADPH to this site appears to be rate limiting for the overall reactions. 3. At redox equilibrium NADPH and NADH reduce FMN and iron-sulphur center 1 of NADH dehydrogenase to the same extents. The rate of reduction of FMN by NADPH is at least two orders of magnitude lower than with NADH. 4. It is concluded that NADPH is a substrate of NADH dehydrogenase and that the nicotinamide nucleotide is oxidized by submitochondrial particles via the NADH--binding site of the enzyme.",
    "output": "The relative rate of oxidation of NADPH compared to NADH by submitochondrial particles and partially purified NADH dehydrogenase is approximately two orders of magnitude lower. This means that the oxidation of NADPH occurs at a rate that is significantly slower than the oxidation of NADH under the same conditions. This is observed with both oxygen and acetylpyridine-NAD as acceptors. The similarities in kinetic characteristics for the NADPH oxidase reaction and reduction of acetylpyridine-NAD by NADPH suggest that both reactions involve the same binding site for NADPH, with the binding of NADPH being rate limiting for the overall reactions. However, the rate of reduction of FMN by NADPH is at least two orders of magnitude lower than with NADH.

    "input": "1. The mechanisms of the reduction of oxaloacetate and of 3-fluoro-oxaloacetate by NADH catalysed by cytoplasmic pig heart malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were investigated. 2. One mol of dimeric enzyme produces 1.7+/-0.4 mol of enzyme-bound NADH when mixed with saturating NAD+ and L-malate at a rate much higher than the subsequent turnover at pH 7.5. 3. Transient measurements of protein and nucleotide fluorescence show that the steady-state complex in the forward direction is MDH-NADH and in the reverse direction MDH-NADH-oxaloacetate. 4. The rate of dissociation of MDH-NADH was measured and is the same as Vmax. in the forward direction at pH 7.5. Both NADH-binding sites are kinetically equivalent. The rate of dissociation varies with pH, as does the equilibrium binding constant for NADH. 5. 3-Fluoro-oxaloacetate is composed of three forms (F1, F2 and S) of which F1 and F2 are immediately substrates for the enzyme. The third form, S, is not a substrate, but when the F forms are used up form S slowly and non-enzymically equilibrates to yield the active substrate forms. S is 2,2-dihydroxy-3-fluorosuccinate. 6. The steady-state compound during the reduction of form F1 is an enzyme form that does not contain NADH, probably MDH-NAD+-fluoromalate. The steady-state compound for form F2 is an enzyme form containing NADH, probably MDH-NADH-fluoro-oxaloacetate. 7. The rate-limiting reaction in the reduction of form F2 shows a deuterium isotope rate ratio of 4 when NADH is replaced by its deuterium analogue, and the rate-limiting reaction is concluded to be hydride transfer. 8. A novel titration was used to show that dimeric cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase contains two sites that can rapidly reduce the F1 form of 3-fluoro-oxaloacetate. The enzyme shows 'all-of-the-sites' behaviour. 9. Partial mechanisms are proposed to explain the enzyme-catalysed transformations of the natural and the fluoro substrates. These mechanisms are similar to the mechanism of pig heart lactate dehydrogenase and this, and the structural results of others, can be explained if the two enzymes are a product of divergent evolution.",
    "output": "The rate-limiting reaction in the reduction of form F2 of 3-fluoro-oxaloacetate is hydride transfer. This conclusion is drawn from the deuterium isotope rate ratio of 4 observed when NADH is replaced by its deuterium analogue. This suggests that the rate-limiting step is the transfer of a hydrogen (H) atom, which consists of a proton (H+) and an electron, and deuterium (D) has a mass slightly larger than hydrogen, causing a slower rate of reaction."

Treatment of the partially purified microsomal or plasma membrane enzyme with neuraminidase resulted in a single peak of activity on isoelectric focusing (pH 3.5--10) with a pI of 9.2. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of either NADase revealed a periodate-Schiff positive band which was coincident with enzyme activity. Compositional analyses of the microsomal enzyme focusing at pH 8.0 confirmed the presence of hexoses, hexosamines and sialic acid. Differences in carbohydrate composition might be important in determining the subcellular distribution of this enzyme.",

    "input": "Studies on nitrate reductase (NAD(P)H:nitrate oxidoreductases EC 1.6.6.2) of Cyanidium caldarium revealed that the enzyme is inhibited by excess of electron donor, NADPH, reduced benzylviologen and FMN. Also dithionite, used to reduce benzylviologen and FMN, inactivates nitrate reductase: however, FMN at an optimal concentration and nitrate, added before the dithionite, protect the enzyme against this inactivation. Cyanide, cyanate and carbamyl phosphate inhibit the enzyme competitively with respect to nitrate, and Ki values are reported. Organic mercurials, 0.1 mM, act preferentially on NADPH activity, whereas Ag+ and Hg-2+ at the same concentration inactivate 80--90% of the benzylviologen and FMN activities. ADP is very poor inhibitor. Urea 4 M in 2 h destroys 90% of the NADPH activity and only 30% of the benzylviologen and FMN activities. The apparent Km values for NADPH, benzylviologen, FMN and nitrate have been determined.",
    "output": "In the provided context, it is stated that organic mercurials, specifically Ag+ and Hg-2+ at a concentration of 0.1 mM, inactivate 80-90% of the activities of benzylviologen and FMN.

    "input": "Initial velocity studies and product inhibition studies were conducted for the forward and reverse reactions of formaldehyde dehydrogenase (formaldehyde: NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1.2.1.1) isolated from a methanol-utilizing yeast Candida boidinii. The data were consistent with an ordered Bi-Bi mechanism for this reaction in which NAD+ is bound first to the enzyme and NADH released last. Kinetic studies indicated that the nucleoside phosphates ATP, ADP and AMP are competitive inhibitors with respect to NAD and noncompetitive inhibitors with respect to S-hydroxymethylglutathione. The inhibitions of the enzyme activity by ATP and ADP are greater at pH 6.0 and 6.5 than at neutral or alkaline pH values. The kinetic studies of formate dehydrogenase (formate:NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1.2.1.2) from the methanol grown C. boidinii suggested also an ordered Bi-Bi mechanism with NAD being the first substrate and NADH the last product. Formate dehydrogenase the last enzyme of the dissimilatory pathway of the methanol metabolism is also inhibited by adenosine phosphates. Since the intracellular concentrations of NADH and ATP are in the range of the Ki values for formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase the activities of these main enzymes of the dissimilatory pathway of methanol metabolism in this yeast may be regulated by these compounds.",
    "output": "The order of substrate binding for the enzyme formaldehyde dehydrogenase (formaldehyde: NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1.2.1.1) in the reaction it catalyzes is an ordered Bi-Bi mechanism. This means that NAD+ binds first, followed by formaldehyde, and NADH is released last."

    "input": "Bovine liver D-glycerate dehydrogenase (D-glycerate:NAD (NADP) oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.29) adapts its kinetic behaviour to a sequential mechanism. The presence of NaCl causes an appreciable variation in the Km and V values. relative to the both substrates in the hydroxypyruvate/D-glycerate dehydrogenase/NADH system, which does not happen in the D-glycerate/D-glycerate dehydrogenase/NAD system. The former system is inhibited by high concentrations of NaCl and activated by low salt concentrations. The hydroxypyruvate concentration causing substrate inhibition increases as the concentration of NaCl increases; excess NADH inhibition is independent of the salt concentration. The variation of the initial rates of both systems, in the presence of chlorides having monovalent and divalent cations, or sodium halides, Na2SO4 and NaNO3 (at constant ionic strength) suggests that the anions have a specific action on the enzyme. An increase in the NaCl concentration causes a displacement of the optimum D-glycerate dehydrogenase pH (with hydroxypyruvate and NADH as substrates) towards the acid area. The enzyme stability, at varying pH, varies with the salt concentration.",
    "output": "The effect of increasing NaCl concentration on the optimum pH of D-glycerate dehydrogenase, when hydroxypyruvate and NADH are used as substrates, is a displacement of the optimum pH towards the acidic area.

    "input": "Oxidative deformylation of 4-hydroxy[14C]methylene-5alpha-cholest-7-en-3-one and oxidative demethylation of [30,31-14C]4,4-dimethyl-5alpha-cholest-7-en-3beta-ol by rat liver microsomes have been compared with regard to the manner in which electrons are introduced from both NADH and NADPH. Evidence suggests that NADH and NADPH support oxidation of both substrates via separate routes of electron transfer. Thus, 10 micron cytochrome c will inhibit NADPH-supported oxidation to 40 to 50% of control activity leaving NADH-supported oxidation unaffected. Also, treatment of microsomes with subtilisin diminishes NADPH-supported oxidation to 10 to 30% of control activity for either substrate to 70 to 90% of control activity while NADH-supported oxidative activity is virtually unaffected. Studies on the oxidase activities and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase as well as NADH-ferricyanide reductase have shown marked differences in activity in the presence of inhibitors. Thus, 9 mM 2'-AMP inhibits NADPH-cytochrome c reductase to 10 to 20% of control activity while NADPH-supported oxidative demethyl ation and deformylation are essentially unchanged. Mersalyl at 15 to 25 nmol/mg of microsomal protein inhibits both reductases to 20 to 40% of control activity; oxidative demethylation is unaffected and oxidative deformylation stimulated slightly when NADPH is used. Finally, antibody to NADPH-cytochrome c reductase inhibits oxidase activity for either substrate to 70 to 90% of control activity while reductase activity is inhibited to 10 to 30% of control activity.",

The rate constant of inactivation depends on protein concentration. With one molecule of NAD bound per tetrameric enzyme, a 50 per cent loss in activity is observed and the rate constant of inactivation becomes independent of the protein concentration over a 30-fold range. Two moles of NAD bound per mole of enzyme fully protect it against inactivation. NADH affords a cooperative effect on enzyme structure similar to that of NAD. Inactivation of 7.8 S apoenzyme is reflected in its dissociation into 4.8-S dimers. In the case of enzyme-NAD1 complex, no direct relationship between the extent of inactivation and dissociation is observed, suggesting that these two processes do not occur simultaneously; we may say that dissociation is slower than inactivation. A mechanism in which the rate-limiting step for inactivation is a conformational change in the tetramer occurring prior to dissociation and affecting only the structure of the non-liganded dimer, is consistent with the experimental observations. Inorganic phosphate protects apoenzyme against inactivation. Its effect is shown to be due to the anion binding at specific sites on the protein with a dissociation constant of 2.6 plus or minus 0.4 mM. The NaC1-induced cold inactivation of glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase is fully reversible at 25 degrees C in the presence of 20 mM dithiothreitol and 50 mM inorganic phosphate. The rate of reactivation is independent of protein concentration. Inactivated enzyme retains the ability to bind specific antibodies produced in rabbits, but diminishes its precipitating capability.",

When the enzyme was immobilized in the presence of NAD+, the enzyme no longer exhibited its normal requirement for NAD+ for full activity. If the immobilized enzyme was then treated with NADase, the requirement for NAD+ was restored. Enzyme immobilized in the absence of NAD+ exhibited normal NAD+ dependence both prior to an after NADase treatment. These results are discussed in terms of co-immobilization of NAD+ at or near the allosteric site of the enzyme.",
    "output": "When the immobilized enzyme (lipoamide dehydrogenase) was treated with NADase after being immobilized in the presence of NAD+, the requirement for NAD+ for full activity was restored. This suggests that the co-immobilization of NAD+ at or near the allosteric site of the enzyme was responsible for the initial loss of NAD+ dependence, and its removal by NADase allowed the enzyme to regain its normal requirement for NAD+."

An electrochemical gradient of protons, which was artificially imposed across the membranes of Streptococcus cells by manipulation of either the K+ diffusion potential or the transmembrane pH gradient, led to ATP synthesis. ATP synthesis was abolished by proton  conductors, an inhibitor of the ATPase or an increase in the extracellular K+ concentration. A comparison between the phosphate potential and the electrochemical proton gradient showed that the data found are in agreement with a stoichiometry of 2 protons translocated per molecule ATP synthesized.",

    "input": "1. The naturally occurring ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase)-inhibitor protein, from bovine heart mitochondria, was obtained as a single pure protein. It was not identical with any of the five subunits (alpha-epsilon) of the isolated ATPase, and appeared to be a single polypeptide chain. 2. The inhibitor combined with the ATPase in a 1:1 molar ratio, producing a completely inhibited ATPase molecule. The affinity of the ATPase for its inhibitor is high; the K(d) is of the order of 10(-8)m. 3. The enthalpy of the ATPase-inhibitor complex-formation is positive, the value of K(d) decreasing as the temperature is raised. This suggests that the forces involved are largely hydrophobic in nature. 4. Hydrolysis of a nucleoside triphosphate promoted formation of the ATPase-inhibitor complex, although the equilibrium position was almost unaffected by the rate of hydrolysis. At low salt concentration, less than 200 turnovers of the ATPase suffice for the ATPase to combine with the inhibitor protein. At higher salt concentrations, a larger number of turnovers is required. It is suggested that the inhibitor binds to a form of the ATPase that is produced transiently during hydrolysis. 5. In the presence of 75mm-K(2)SO(4), the rates of association and dissociation are slow enough to allow their kinetics to be studied. Association is first-order in inhibitor concentration, but fractional order in ATPase concentration. Dissociation is first-order in ATPase-inhibitor complex concentration. The temperature coefficients of the ;on' and ;off' processes were also measured. 6. A simple kinetic model for the ATPase-inhibitor interaction is proposed that can be extended to take into account release of inhibitor protein under energized conditions on the membrane. 7. The isolated ATPase is inhibited by preincubation with Mg(2+), reversible by subsequent addition of EDTA, and by ADP, reversible by subsequent addition of ATP. These effects are not found on the membrane-bound ATPase. The mechanism of these effects is discussed.",
    "output": "The order of association for the ATPase and its inhibitor is first-order with respect to inhibitor concentration, but fractional order in ATPase concentration. This means that the rate of association depends on the concentration of the inhibitor, but not to a simple power of the ATPase concentration. The rate of dissociation, on the other hand, is first-order in the ATPase-inhibitor complex concentration."

Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) was not detected from cell suspensions obtained from hearts which had been left asystolic for 10 min.2. It was found that ATP 0.34 +/- 0.22 muM/mg protein was released by cells kept in an oxygenated condition, while ATP 1.28 +/- 0.41 muM/mg protein was initially released by cells made hypoxic.3. Addition of Ca(2+) in a concentration of 2 mM caused cells to initially extrude ATP 0.40 +/- 0.14 muM/mg protein. This was attributed to an inotropic effect.4. Extracellular ATPase activity in the fluid suspension was partially characterized, giving a K(m) of 13 muM and a V/2 of hydrolysed ATP 18.3 muM/min at 37 degrees C. Q(10) was found to be 4 between 25 and 37 degrees C. Enzyme activity remained unaffected by either hypoxic conditions or ouabain.5. If these amounts of ATP are released from myocardial cells rendered hypoxic in vivo, then it must be concluded that ATP plays a principal role in the local control of myocardial blood flow.6. It is proposed that release of ATP occurs through the sarcolemma from an intracellular pool, and that alteration of the configuration of structural membrane protein controls the amounts of ATP extruded.",

    "instruction": "What is the effect of adding the ATPase inhibitor subunit back to the activated enzyme on its activity?",
    "input": "The 13S coupling factor of oxidative phosphorylation from Alcaligenes faecalis has a latent adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) function that can be activated by heating at 55 degrees C for 10 min at pH 8.5 in 50% glycerol. The specific activity increases from 0.1 to 20--30 mumol min-1 mg-1. Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) is not required for stabilization at 55 degreesC when glycerol is present. Activation involves displacement of the endogenous ATPase inhibitor subunit (epsilon subunit), and readdition of this subunit results in deactivation. In the deactivation process the ATPase inhibitor subunit can be replaced by other cationic proteins such as protamine, histones, or poly(lysine). Mg2+ and H+ also are effective deactivators. The fact that every positively charged substance tested deactivated the enzyme suggests that the inhibitor subunit is complexed with the enzyme at a site containing a surplus of negative charges. The activated enzyme is not labile, but it is salt labile, having a half-life of 2-3 min in 0.1 M KI at either 25 or 0 degrees C. The activated ATPase is also inhibited by aurovertin, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD), and by the cross-linking agent dimethyl suberimidate. Evidence for polymorphism comes from finding that the properties of the unactivated enzyme (intrinsic ATPase) are different in many ways from the properties of activated ATPase. With respect to the coupling factor's ability to hydrolyze ATP, the data in this study suggest that there are at least four distinct functional allomorphs of this enzyme: (1) the latent enzyme, which has no kinetically measurable ATPase activity, (2) intrinsic ATPase, which is catalyzed by a small percentage of the molecular population that has been activated by some natural mechanism, (3) activated ATPase, which has properties different from those of intrinsic ATPase, and (4) aged activated ATPase, in which some of the properties (Km for substrate, sensitivity to deactivation by Mg2+ and H+) spontaneously change within 30 min.",
    "output": "Adding the ATPase inhibitor subunit back to the activated enzyme results in deactivation of the enzyme. This is because the inhibitor subunit, such as the epsilon subunit, is displaced during activation and its readdition leads to a return to the latent state. The inhibitor subunit can also be replaced by other cationic proteins, such as protamine, histones, or poly(lysine), which also deactivate the enzyme. Additionally, Mg2+ and H+ are effective deactivators, suggesting that the inhibitor subunit interacts with a site on the enzyme containing a surplus of negative charges."

Cyclic AMP was not a necessary component in the activation as initially suspected; neither was the involvement of a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase detected. The enzyme activation by Mg+2-ATP was totally retained after dialysis, thus excluding the possibility of an allosteric effect. In contrast to the activation, TPH was found to be sensitive to inactivation by acid phosphatase, a dephosphorylating enzyme. These findings are consistent with the proposal that the enzyme activation may involve a phosphorylation process. Furthermore, the activation by Mg+2-ATP in the brain preparations was only minimally observed from neonatal mice and could be abolished from adult mice by administration of hydrocortisone. It appears that the phosphorylation process, as postulated here, may be under developmental and hormonal influences.",

The enzyme was Mg2+ dependent; Co2+ and Mn2+ but not Ca2+ could replace Mg2+ to some extent; the activation by Mg2+ was slightly antagonized by Ca2+. Even in the presence of Mg2+, Na+ or K+ had no stimulatory effect. The ATPase reaction was effectively inhibited by one of its products, ADP, and only slightly by the other product, inorganic phosphate. Of the nucleoside triphosphates tested ATP was hydrolyzed with highest affinity ([S]0.5 v = 1.3 mM) and maximal activity (120 U/g). The ATPase activity could be nearly  completely solubilized by treatment of the membranes with 2 M LiCl in the absence of Mg2+. Solubilization, however, led to instability of the enzyme. The clostridial solubilized and membrane-bound ATPase showed different properties similar to the \"allotopic\" properties of mitochondrial and other bacterial ATPases. The membrane-bound ATPase in contrast to the soluble ATPase was sensitive to the ATPase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD). DCCD, at 10(-4) M, led to 80% inhibition of the membrane-bound enzyme; oligomycin ouabain, or NaN3 had no effect. The membrane-bound ATPase could not be stimulated by trypsin pretreatment. Since none of the mono- or divalent cations had any truly stimulatory effect, and since a pH gradient (interior alkaline), which was sensitive to the ATPase inhibitor DCCD, was maintained during growth of C. pasteurianum, it was concluded that the function of the clostridial ATPase was the same as that of the rather similar mitochondrial enzyme, namely H+ translocation. A H+-translocating, ATP-consuming ATPase appears to be intrinsic equipment of all prolaryotic cells and as such to be phylogenetically very old; in the course of evolution the enzyme might have been developed to a H+-(re)translocating, ATP-forming ATPase as probably realized in aerobic bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts.",

The values of Km app. and kcat were determined to be 6-10(-4) and 6 mumoles/mg/min respectively. It is shown that ADP is an effective inhibitor of the ATPase reaction, and the inhibition activity increases in the presence of an excess of Ca2+.

    "input": "ATPase activity and phosphorylation by [gamma-32P] ATP of isolated plasma membrane of alveolar macorphages are stimulated in a parallel fashion by physiologic concentrations of Ca2+, with half-maximal activating effect of this ion at (3--7) X 10(-7) M. For various membrane preparations, a direct proportionality exists between Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity and amount of 32P incorporated. Labeling of membrane attains the steady-state level by 10 sec at 0 degrees C, and is rapidly reversed by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), K+ decreases the amount of membrane-bound 32P, mainly by enhancing the rate of dephosphorylation of the 32P-intermediate. Hydroxylamine causes a release of about 90% of 32P bound to the membrane, thus indicating that the 32P-intermediate contains an acyl-phosphate bond. When the labeled plasma membrane is solubilized and electrophoresed on acrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate, the radioactivity appears to be largely associated with a single protein fraction of 132,000 +/- 2,000 aarent molecular weight. These features of the macrophage Ca2+-ATPase suggest that the enzyme activity might be part of a surface-localized Ca1+-extrusion system, participating in the regulation of Ca2+-dependent activities of the macrophage.",

    "input": "In stopped-flow experiments in which oxidized cytochrome c oxidase was mixed with ferrocytochrome c in the presence of a range of oxygen concentrations and in the absence and presence of cyanide, a fast phase, reflecting a rapid approach to an equilibrium, was observed. Within this phase, one or two molecules of ferrocytochrome were oxidized per haem group of cytochrome a, depending on the concentration of ferrocytochrome c used. The reasons for this are discussed in terms of a mechanism in which all electrons enter through cytochrome a, which, in turn, is in rapid equilibrium with a second site, identified with 'visible' copper (830 nm-absorbing) Cud (Beinert et al., 1971). The value of the bimolecular rate constant for the reaction between cytochromes c2+ and a3+ was between 10(6) and 10(7) M(-1)-S(-1); some variability from preparation to preparation was observed. At high ferrocytochrome c concentrations, the initial reaction of cytochrome c2+ with cytochrome a3+ could be isolated from the reaction involving the 'visible' copper and the stoicheiometry was found to approach one molecule of cytochrome c2+ oxidized for each molecule of cytochrome a3+ reduced. At low ferrocytochrome c concentrations, however, both sites (i.e. cytochrome a and Cud) were reduced simultaneously and the stoicheiometry of the initial reaction was closer to two molecules of cytochrome c2+ oxidized per molecule of cytochrome a reduced. The bleaching of the 830 nm band lagged behind or was simultaneous with the formation of the 605 nm band and does not depend on the cytochrome c concentration, whereas the extinction at the steady-state does. The time-course of the return of the 830 nm-absorbing species is much faster than the bleaching of the 605 nm-absorbing component, and parallels that of the turnover phase of cytochrome c2+ oxidation. Additions of cyanide to the oxidase preparations had no effect on the observed stoicheiometry or kinetics of the reduction of cytochrome a and 'visible' copper, but inhibited electron transfer to the other two sites, cytochrome a3 and the undetectable copper, Cuu.",

Horse, human, yeast iso-2, and carboxydinitrophenyl (CDNP)-lysine-60 horse cytochromes c all give initial rates of electron transfer that are equal to those observed in whole beef mitochondria. Euglena, CDNP-lysine-72, and CDNP-lysine-13 horse cytochromes c give rates about one-tenth that of whole mitochondria. These rates were independent of the concentration of cytochrome c. Since the inhibited cytochromes c, but not the active proteins, had previously been shown to have lowered affinity for cytochrome oxidase, the results indicate that the structural characteristics important for the association of cytochrome c and oxidase are also essential for achieving normal rates of electron transfer within the complex once formed.",

    "input": "The interactions of cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c from bovine cardiac mitochondria were investigated. Cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c formed a 1:1 molecular complex in aqueous solutions of low ionic strength. The complex was stable to Sephadex G-75 chromatography. The formation and stability of the complex were independent of the oxidation state of the cytochrome components as far as those reactions studied were concerned. The complex was dissociated in solutions of ionic strength higher than 0.07 or pH exceeding 10 and only partially dissociated in 8 M urea. No complexation occurred when cytochrome c was acetylated on 64% of its lysine residues or photooxidized on its 2 methionine residues. Complexes with molecular ratios of less than 1:1 (i.e. more cytochrome c) were obtained when polymerized cytochrome c, or cytochrome c with all lysine residues guanidinated, or a \"1-65 heme peptide\" from cyanogen bromide cleavage of cytochrome c was used. These results were interpreted to imply that the complex was predominantly maintained by ionic interactions probably involving some of the lysine residues of cytochrome c but with major stabilization dependent on the native conformations of both cytochromes. The reduced complex was autooxidizable with biphasic kinetics with first order rate constants of 6 X 10(-5) and 5 X U0(-5) s-1 but did not react with carbon monoxide. The complex reacted with cyanide and was reduced by ascorbate at about 32% and 40% respectively, of the rates of reaction with cytochrome c alone. The complex was less photoreducible than cytochrome c1 alone. The complex exhibited remarkably different circular dichroic behavior from that of the summation of cytochrome c1 plus cytochrome c. We concluded that when cytochromes c1 and c interacted they underwent dramatic conformational changes resulting in weakening of their heme crevices. All results available would indicate that in the complex cytochrome c1 was bound at the entrance to the heme crevice of cytochrome c on the methionine-80 side of the heme crevice.",
    "output": "The complex between cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c from bovine cardiac mitochondria dissociates when the pH exceeds 10 or the ionic strength is higher than 0.07. This dissociation is likely due to the disruption of ionic interactions and the native conformations of both cytochromes, which are major stabilizers of the complex. The complex also partially dissociates in 8 M urea. The complexation occurs primarily through ionic interactions involving some lysine residues of cytochrome c, but the native conformations of both cytochromes also play a significant role in the stability of the complex."

    "input": "The reaction between cytochrome c oxidase and ferrocytochrome c has been investigated by the stopped-flow method. It has been found that only one electron acceptor, a heme group, in the oxidase is rapidly reduced by cytochrome c. The presence of N3- does not affect the reduction of the acceptor, which supports the hypothesis that this is identical with cytochrome a. The results are consistent with the existence of a simple equilibrium between cytochrome a and cytochrome c: c-2 + a-3+  in equilibrium c-3+ + a-2+ with an equilibrium constant corresponding to an oxidation-reduction potential of cytochrome a 30 mV higher than that for cytochrome c at pH 7.4. The oxidation-reduction potential of the a-3+ /a-2+ couple, 285 mV (based on a potential of 255 mV for cytochrome c), and the optical properties of the reduced form indicate that it is identical with neither of the reduced hemes seen in potentiometric titrations. The oxidase species resulting from the rapid reduction of cytochrome a by cytochrome c is proposed to represent a metastable intermediate state which, under anaerobic conditions, eventually is transformed into a more stable state characterized by a reduced high-potential heme.",
    "output": "The oxidation-reduction potential of the a-3+ /a-2+ couple is 285 mV. This value is higher than that for cytochrome c by 30 mV, given that the potential for cytochrome c is 255 mV.

The observed time courses were complex, the reaction consisting of three phases. Of these, only the fastest process, with a second-order rate constant of 3.3 X 10(4) M-1.S-1, was dependent on oxygen concentration. The two slower processes were first-order reactions with rates of 1.0 +/- 0.4s-1 and 0.1 +/- 0.03s-1. A kinetic titration experiment revealed that the enzyme had a relatively low affinity constant for oxygen, approx. 10(4)M-1. Kinetic difference spectra were determined for all three reaction phases, showing each to have different characteristics. The fast-phase difference spectrum showed that changes occurred at both the haem c and haem d1 components of the enzyme during this process. These changes were consistent with the haem c becoming oxidized, but with the haem d1 assuming a form that did not correspond to the normal oxidized state, a situation that was not restored even after the second kinetic phase, which reflected further changes in the haem d1 component. The results are discussed in terms of a kinetic scheme.",

The changes observed in the u.v. region of the spectrum are consistent with the introduction of a single residue of the reagent, and the normal fluorescence of tryptophan is lost. The chemically modified protein exhibits marked changes in its functional properties as compared with native cytochrome c. Unlike the native monomer, the modified cytochrome c has a pH-dependent spectrum which is typical of a high-spin species in the alpha/beta region at low pH, changing to a low-spin species with an apparent pK of 7.5.

The average heme exposure in both the ferric and ferrous cytochromes c-551.5 was found to be considerably greater than that previously observed for the monoheme mitochondrial cytochrome c and Prosthecochloris cytochrome c-555. Differences in the average heme exposure for ferric and ferrous cytochromes c-551.5 suggested that a change in oxidation state is accompanied by a change in conformation. A spectrophotometric redox titration of the protein yielded a sigmoidal plot of the potential versus the logarithm of the ratio of oxidized to reduced heme.

More than 50% of the submitochondrial particle membrane is in the 'inverted' configuration, shielding the catalytically active cytochrome c. The 'endogenous' cytochrome c of particles turns over at a maximal rate between 450 and 550 s-1 during the oxidation of succinate or ascorbate plus TMPD; the maximal turnover rate for cytochrome c in mitochondria is 300-400 s-1, at 28 degrees-30 degrees C, pH 7.4. 2. Ascorbate plus N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylene diamine added to antimycin-treated particles induces anomalous absorption increases between 555 and 565 nm during the aerobic steady state, which disappear upon anaerobiosis; succinate addition abolishes this cycle and permits the partial resolution of cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c steady states at 552.5-547 nm and 550-556.5 nm, respectively. 3. Cytochrome c1 is rather more reduced than cytochrome c during the oxidation of succinate and of ascorbate + N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylene diamine in both mitochondria and submitochondrial particles; a near equilibrium condition exists between cytochromes c1 and c in the aerobic steady state, with a rate constant for the c1 leads to c reduction step greater than 10(3) s-1. 4. The greater apparent response of the c/aa3 electron transfer step to salts, the hyperbolic inhibition of succinate oxidation by azide and cyanide, and the kinetic behaviour of the succinate-cytochrome c reductase system, are all explicable in terms of a near-equilibrium condition prevailing at the c1/c step. Endogenous cytochrome c of mitochondria and submitochondrial particles is apparently largely bound to cytochrome aa3 units in situ. Cytochrome c1 can either reduce the cytochrome c-cytochrome aa3 complex directly, or requires only a small extra amount of cytochrome c to carry the full electron transfer flux.",

    "input": "Cytochrome c has been chemically modified by methylene blue mediated photooxidation. It is established that the methionine residues of the protein have been specifically converted to methionine sulfoxide residues. No oxidation of any other amino acid residues or the cysteine thioether bridges of the molecule occurs during the photooxidation reaction. The absorbance spectrum of methionine sulfoxide ferricytochrome c at neutrality is similar to that of the unmodified protein except for an increase in the extinction coefficient of the Soret absorbance band and for the complete loss of the ligand sensitive 695 nm absorbance band in the spectrum of the derivative. The protein remains in the low spin configuration which implies the retention of two strong field ligands. Spin state sensitive spectral titrations and model studies of heme peptides indicate that the sixth ligand is definitely not provided by a lysine residue but may be methionine-80 sulfoxide coordinated via its sulfur atom. Circular dichroism spectra indicate that the heme crevice of methionine sulfoxide ferri- and ferrocytochrome c is weakened relative to native cytochrome c. The redox potential of methionine sulfoxide cytochrome c is 184 mV which is markedly diminished from the 260 mV redox potential of native cytochrome c. The modified protein is equivalent to native cytochrome c as a substrate for cytochrome oxidase and is not autoxidizable at neutral pH but is virtually inactive with succinate-cytochrome c reductase. These results indicate that the major role of the methionine-80 in cytochrome c is to preserve a closed hydrophobic heme crevice which is essential for the maintainance of the necessary redox potential.",
    "output": "The redox potential of methionine sulfoxide cytochrome c is 184 mV, which is significantly lower than the redox potential of native cytochrome c, which is 260 mV. This decrease in redox potential is likely due to the modification of methionine residues to methionine sulfoxide residues, which affects the structure and function of the protein, particularly in the heme crevice where it weakens the environment. This change in redox potential may impact the protein's role as a substrate for certain enzymes, such as cytochrome oxidase and succinate-cytochrome c reductase."

The kinetics of reaction of ten different mono(4-carboxy-2,6-dinitrophenyl) derivatives of horse cytochrome c were determined. The modified proteins showed higher apparent K(m) values than the native protein and greater sensitivity to ionic strength, defining an interaction domain on cytochrome c for purified cytochrome c reductase. This interaction site is located on the front surface of the molecule (which contains the exposed heme edge) and surrounds the point at which the positive end of the dipole axis crosses the surface of the protein. The site is similar to that previously determined for mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase and yeast cytochrome c peroxidase, suggesting that the primary interaction with redox partners is directed by the dipolar charge distribution on cytochrome c. The extensive overlapping of the interaction domains for the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase and reductase indicates that cytochrome c must be mobile in order to transfer electrons between them, depending on their relative positions in the membrane. Whether such mobility is necessary in intact mitochondria depends on whether the interactions with the complete membrane-bound system are the same as with the purified components.",

In this longitudinal sutdy the specific accent was put on the intensified induction treatment of 8 weeks' duration which was thought to achieve a higher remission quality. In this phase 8 effective drugs were applied up to the patient's tolerance limits; in addition prophylactic irradiation to the central nervous system was given in two modifications. After 4 weeks all patients were in complete remission. During the first 4 months 6 children died due to complications for which therapy must be at least partially responsible. 17 out of 67 patients relapsed between 4 and 59 months after diagnosis, which corresponds to a remission rate according to the life table analysis of 62% (50 out of 67 patients in first remission). The majority of patients with relapse is characterized at diagnosis by a specific pattern of clinical findings. 2 therapy groups, differently treated in respect to central nervous system irradaiation and duration of continuation therapy, do not at present statistically differ from each other. According to statistics 8 more children may be expected to suffer from relapse. The improved results are due to a lower incidence of bone marrow relapses; it seems that there is a direct relation between intensity of treatment during the induction phase and the occurrence of bone marrow relapses. The specific problems of the presented study take place during the induction phase, which, due to toxicity, regularly results in a number of side effects and severe complications. In order to realize the induction therapy, the use of prophylactic and supportive procedures is of utmost importance. Profound knowledge of possible side effects and complications is most essential as well as the knowledge of how to cope with these problems. It is the authors' opinion that the induction phase can only be performed in specialized institutions, because only at these places enough information may be obtained from an adequate number of patients and only there pediatric oncologists may share in the decisions and responsibilities.

Although acute leukemia may occur in a higher than expected frequency in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma because of an increased risk of a second neoplasm in patients with a primary tumor, it seems more likely that the acute leukemia may be related to the radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy administered to treat the lymphoma. Late death from leukemia after chemotherapeutic or radiotherapeutic remission of advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is preferable to morbidity and/or early death from untreated or inadequately treated lymphoma.",

Of this population the majority had acute mielocytic leukemia, followed by acute myelomonocytic leukemia. Absolutely all patients at the time of diagnosis and subsequently every 4 to 6 weeks had a bone marrow aspiration test. When the patients were first seen, 54% of them presented fever; lymph node enlargement was not a common finding. Only few of this patients presented splenomegaly and/or hepatomegaly. In regards to complete blood counts the most outstanding of its was the presence of leukocyte count above 20000/mm.3 in 8 of this patients. From the 22 patients studied only 21 are evaluable.

It is now possible to achieve complete remission in about 60% of all patients with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) using optimal polychemotherapy. This significant advance is in part due to improved supportive measures such as transfusions and isolation etc., which are frequently necessary during the induction phase of treatment. Unfortunately, such remissions are still of relatively short duration and seldom exceed 1 year. The treatment of relapses remains less successful. The first attempts to include immunotherapy in the treatment of AML have also been rather disappointing. Today remissions are obtained in 70% of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) which last, on the average, almost 1 1/2 years. These results, however, do not approach those in childhood ALL.

PG was highly effective in controlling lethal infections induced in mice by the major immunotypes of P. aeruginosa; greater than or equal to 10 microgram of of gamma-globulin per mouse protected against challenge with less than or equal to 10(6) 50% lethal doses of P. aeruginosa. PG was less than or equal to 57 times more effective than normal human gamma-globulin. The active antibody component is specific for each immunotype; it is of the IgG type and undoubltedly is directed against the O-antigen. PG was was not protective against challenge with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, or Klebsiella pneumoniae; a low degree of cross-protection was seen against Serratia marcescens. In a model infection involving mice in a terminal stage of advanced P. aeruginosa infection, human plasma immune to P. aeruginosa proved ineffective, but the gamma-globulin component showed moderate activity. The apparent irreversibility of this late-stage infection is not clearly ascribable to a toxin. It is postulated that the successful treatment of advanced P. aeruginosa infections in humans would require multiple therapeutic approaches, including passive immunization with a high-potency, specifically immune globulin.",

Anesthetized CBA/L\u00fc mice were subjected to a 15-s flame burn and infected with a wild-type protease-producing strain and two of its protease-deficient mutants. The average bacterial cell mean lethal dose (LD50) of 3.8 +/- 0.3 standard deviation (log10) for mice infected with the protease-producing P. aeruginosa was at least 1 log lower than the LD50 of the protease-deficient mutants (0.02 greater than P greater than 0.01). The addition of purified protease to the infecting inoculum of protease-deficient strains reduced the LD50. Although the generation time in vitro was the same for all three bacterial strains used, there were consistently fewer viable bacteria in the blood of mice infected with protease-deficient strains than in those infected with the protease-producing strain. When a protease-deficient strain was mixed with the protease-producing wild-type strain, the number of protease-producing pseudomonas found in the blood remained constant, whereas the number of protease-deficient organisms increased, suggesting that protease contributed to the invasiveness of the organisms. The survival of mice infected with protease-producing pseudomonas was enhanced by antiprotease serum. Antiprotease serum had no effect in mice infected with protease-deficient mutants.",

    "input": "Protein accounted for an average of 8.7% w/w of the hyaluronic acid obtained from rooster comb dermis extracts and three types of peptide constituents appeared to be present. A few collagen-like fibers were closely associated with the hyaluronic acid when samples were examined in the electron microscope and collagenase treatment decreased the intrinsic viscosity from 7000-5000 ml/g to 3900-2700 ml/g. The quantities of collagen present, however, were too small to detect chemically with the methods employed. The major peptide consituent was readily separated from the hyaluronic acid by fractionation in a cesium chloride gradient or by treatment with pronase. The viscosity was decreased by the density gradient procedure but not by the pronase digestion. Repeated fractionation in a cesium chloride gradient decreased the intrinsic viscosity still further and a small peptide constituent with a high glycine and serine content remained associated with a hyaluronic acid. The data suggest that an interaction or entanglement with collagen fibers is responsible for the high viscosity of hyaluronic acid in this tissue extract and that the viscosity of purified hyaluronic acid preparations is dependent upon interactions between adjacent polysaccharide chains. Interactions between the major peptide constituent and polysaccharide chains or the small residual peptide component remaining with hyaluronic acid after extensive purification procedures, however, appear to be involved in some organized structure because the presence of the major peptide constituent minimized the decrease in viscosity that occurred when hyaluronic acid samples were lyophilized.",
    "output": "Collagenase treatment resulted in a decrease in the intrinsic viscosity of hyaluronic acid from 7000-5000 ml/g to 3900-2700 ml/g. This decrease suggests that the hyaluronic acid was interacting or entangled with collagen fibers, and the removal of these collagen fibers by collagenase treatment led to a decrease in viscosity. The viscosity was not significantly affected by the presence of the major peptide constituent or the small residual peptide component remaining with hyaluronic acid after extensive purification procedures. However, the presence of the major peptide constituent minimized the decrease in viscosity that occurred when hyaluronic acid samples were lyophilized, indicating that it may be involved in some organized structure."

The procollagen, which represents the major collagenous protein in culture medium, was specifically precipitated by antibodies to bovine type III procollagen and was purified by diethyl-aminoethylcellulose chromatography. Unequivocal identification of the pepsin-treated collagen was made by direct comparison with type III collagen isolated by pepsin digestion of bovine skin, utilizing peptide cleavage patterns generated by vertebrate collagenase, CNBr, and mast cell protease. The type III collagen was hydroxylated to a high degree, having a hydroxyproline/proline ratio of 1.5:1.0. Pulse-chase studies indicated that the procollagen was not processed to procollagen intermediates or to collagen. Pepsin treatment of cell layers, followed by salt fractionation at acidic and neutral pH, produced several components which were sensitive to bacterial collagenase and which comigrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with alpha A, alpha B, and type IV collagen chains purified from human placenta by similar techniques. Bovine aortic endothelial cells also secreted fibronectin and a bacterial collagenase-insensitive glycoprotein which, after reduction, had a molecular weight of 135,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (using procollagen molecular weight standards) and which was not precipitable by antibodies to cold-insoluble globulin or to alpha 2-macroglobulin. Collagen biosynthesis by these cells provides an interesting model system for studying the polarity of protein secretion and the attachment of cells to an extracellular matrix. The presence of type III collagen in the subendothelium and the specific interaction of this protein with fibronectin and platelets suggest the involvement of this collagen in thrombus formation following endothelial cell injury.",

The activities of these two types of enzymes are high (especially collagenases) in tissues of acute inflammations when the granuloma is resorbing. These activities are lower in sub-acute inflammation and the collagen content of the persistent granuloma remains high. The collagen synthesized in granulation tissues is cross linked by hydroxylysino-5-keto-norleucine, the stable cross-link of collagen in embryonic skin. It is progressively replaced by the two aldimine cross links of normal adult skin when the granuloma is resorbed (acute inflammations induced in rats; human normal scars). The cross link of embryonic skin, on the contrary, is permanently present in collagen of tissues of subacute, chronic inflammations (sponge implants in rats, human hypertrophic scars and keloids.

The collagenase in cell cultures is present in a latent form (40,000 MW) like that obtained from organ cultures of ulcerating corneas and can be activated proteolytically. Production of the latent collagenase in cell culture depends upon the presence of serum and diminishes greatly when serum is removed from the medium. Collagenase activity can be demonstrated after the latent collagenase has been separated from serum antiproteases in the media. Alternatively, careful titration of the crude media with trypsin to saturate serum antiproteases, to release collagenase from the complex with alpha 2-macroglobulin, and to activate latent collagenase also results in measurable collagenase activity.

    "input": "Three different types of neutral proteases related to collagen metabolism have been found in the granule fraction of human leucocytes from normal adults, using collagen, gelatin, and synthetic peptides as substrates. These are collagenase, an enzyme showing a potent hydrolytic activity against gelatin but little against native collagen, and one splitting the cross-links region of collagen. Their molecular weights were estimated to be about 75,000 150,000, and 25,000, respectively, by gel chromatography. The former two enzymes were inhibited by a alpha2-macroglobulin and ethylenediaminetetraacetate, but not by alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha1-antitrypsin) or phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, while the latter enzyme, associated in behavior with an enzyme hydrolyzing succinyl-(l-alanyl)3-p-nitroanilide, was inhibited by alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, alpha2-macroglobulin, and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, but not by ethylenediaminetetraacetate. A possible cooperative function of these enzymes in collagen catabolism is discussed.",

These five suspicious strains were identified as Cl. difficle according to the tests mentioned in the previous paragraphs. The organisms isolated here showed the same characteristics as five of the strains received and also as the organisms isolated from the inoculated animals with the crude cultures of Cl. difficile. These organisms were variable in size, roughly 2-9 XO.3-0. 8u, Gram positive rods, motile, capsulated, flagellated, most probably peritrichous, possessing non-bulging spores located terminally or subterminally, free spores were rarely detectable. Cell arrangements: singly or in pairs and occasionally in short chains. On longer incubation the organisms slightly shifted to become Gram variable and longer in size. Colonies on ordinary agar and solid blood agar appeared to be punctiform and rough. On the other hand the colony appearance on the rest of the solid media which are mentioned previously are as follows: 1-3 mm in diameter, greenish, smooth, non-haemolytic, entire some showing slight irregularities of their edges. Colonies slightly raised, butyrous and semi opaque to opaque. This organism does not liquify the serum of Loeffler medium and also does not cause any changes of this medium. The metachromatic granules are readily seen by Albert's staining. Neither proteolytic nor lipolytic activities are possessed by this organism. Sensitivity to antibiotics showed the same pattern as mentioned about the strains received.",

    "input": "Bacteriological tests were done on a large number of different strains of Actinobacillus seminis and also, repeatedly, on the same culture or on different cultures taken periodically from the same donor animal. These tests were also applied to strains of A. seminis representing different serological types, which in turn were compared with strains of Brucella ovis. The tests as applied proved that A. seminis strains have defined, morphological, staining, cultural and biochemical properties, although they can generally be regarded as biochemically inactive. Growth was greatly enhanced on media enriched with blood or serum and also more luxuriant when incubated in a carboxophilic atmosphere. Nitrate reduction was found to be a variable characteristic, as it was more often negative, while weakly positive and negative reactions for hydrogen sulphide production were encountered with equal frequency. On the basis of their bacteriological properties, the strains representing the different serological types can be divided into 2 groups. Strains belonging to the first of these groups conform to the earlier description of A. seminis by Baynes & Simmons (1960) and are usually catalase positive and oxidase negative, while those in the second group more closely resemble Histophilus ovis described by Roberts (1956), and produce variable reactions on the catalase and oxidase tests. Although growth did occur aerobically and was more luxuriant in a carboxyophilic atmosphere in all strains, it was always much slower for strains resembling H. ovis. Similarly, the growth produced by these strains was poorer and more irregular on ordinary nutrient media and, although greatly enhanced and more regular in all strains on enriched media, it was again much slower for these strains. In all stages of development, the colonies of strains similar to H. ovis were always slower and more transparent in appearance, and tended to remain low convex and undifferentiated. Packed organisms of these strains were light yellow (lemon) in colour in contrast to strains resembling A. seminis, which had a greyish-white appearance. A. seminis and B. ovis can clearly be distinguished on their morphology, Stamp staining reaction on both semen and culture smears, colonial morphology, the delayed colony development of B. ovis and sensitivity to dyes and antibiotics.",

The type culture collection strains all showed different characteristics with respect to growth rates and pH optima for growth. Production of phospholipase C (alpha-toxin), haemolysin and lethal activity varied considerably between the different types. Growth and extracellular protein production in fermenters with pH control and static or stirred cultures were compared. Production of all extracellular proteins measured was markedly improved by cultivation in fermenters with pH control. Strain ATCC13124 produced five times more phospholipase C than any of 28 freshly isolated strains of C. perfringens type A, grown under identical conditions. Haemolytic and lethal activities of the ATCC strain were equal or superior to the activities of any of the freshly isolated strains.

The composition of the medium proved to be crucial. Trypticase Soy Broth with 4% Yeast Extract meeting the requirements. The effect of the Yeast Extract is obscure, for some strains also formed detectable bacteriocins in a special Trypticase medium without this agent. It was noted that the broth should be filter-sterilized rather than autoclaved and only a few days old. Attempts at liberating cell-bound bacteriocins from washed cells were unsuccessful, even when they were treated with ultrasound, EDTA, or various chemicals followed by ultrasound. On the basis of size and sensitivity to heat the bacteriocins could be divided into two groups, while their resistance to ether and chloroform and to trypsin did not follow this pattern. Dependence on plasmids could not be demonstrated by attempts at curing with acridine orange or ethidium bromide; and the involvement of phages was unlikely, since the inhibition was not transmissible and phage-like structures were not observed in the electron microscope.",

These include patients with technically limited CT scans or those in whom the possibility of an associated vascular lesion of the cervical or intracranial vessel is clinically suspected. (3) It is essential to obtain CT scans of the best possible quality. Sedation will be required in many instances, but this is considered worth doing because a normal CT scan, without significant technical limitations, will exclude the presence of lesions requiring prompt surgical intervention. Those patients who require surgery will need general anesthesia under any circumstances.

Seventy percent of the patients clinically diagnosed as contusion had positive CT scans, and for all practical purposes, 100 percent of patients having trauma more severe than our Group III (contusion) had abnormal CT scans. Likewise, the number and intensity of tissue abnormalities on CT scans increase proportionately with the severity of the clinical signs and symptons.

The overall diagnostic accuracy of CT scanning was 93.4%, whereas the accuracy of isotope scanning, angiography, and pneumoencephalography was 55.4, 81 and 100% respectively. The criteria used in making the diagnosis with CT scanning are listed. The results indicate that CT scanning is the initial diagnostic procedure of choice, but that other modalities, particularly angiography, are still required for more accurate evaluation in the majority of cases.",

    "input": "Computed tomography (CT) is a highly accurate method of detecting intraabdominal and pelvic nodal involvement in patients with lymphoma. The correlation between CT and lymphangiographic findings in this series of 80 surgically proven and nonproven cases was high (84%). CT is superior to lymphangiography in demonstrating abnormality in such areas as the high retrocrural or the mesenteric nodes where contrast material from bipedal lymphangiography does not reach. An abnormal CT scan eliminates the need for lymphangiography, and normal CT scan at 2 cm intervals can exclude retroperitoneal adenopathy with high confidence. If details of internal nodal architecture are required, a lymphangiogram can also be performed. Lymphangiography is also indicated in patients where CT is equivocal either because of lack of fat or gross motion artefacts.",

    "input": "Computer tomography (CT), a new radiographic examination technique, is very highly efficient, for it has high informative content with little stress for the patient. In contrast to the conventional X-ray technology, CT succeeds, by direct presentation of the structure of the soft parts, in obtaining information which comes close to that of macroscopic neuropathology. The capacity and limitations of the method at the present stage of development are reported. Computer tomography cannot displace conventional neuroradiological methods of investigation, although it is rightly presented as a screening method and helps towards selective use. Indications, technical integration and handling of CT are prerequisites for the exhaustive benefit of the excellent new technique.",
    "output": "CT (Computer Tomography) succeeds in obtaining information that conventional X-ray technology does not by providing high-resolution images of the soft tissues and organs, which is close to that of macroscopic neuropathology. This is particularly beneficial in diagnosing conditions like tumors, trauma, and diseases of the brain, spine, and other internal organs. Unlike conventional X-rays, CT can produce detailed cross-sectional images, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the internal structures. However, it's important to note that CT is not a replacement for conventional neuroradiological methods, but rather a complementary tool that aids in the selective use of these methods."

The secretory volume of gastric juice was markedly decreased, whereas, acid concentration remained unchanged. Pepsin concentration, on the contrary, was reduced significantly. The degree of inhibition of pepsin output, therefore, was greater than that of acid output. No significant difference in the extent of inhibition of acid or pepsin output was observed between control subjects and patients with duodenal ulcer.",

    "input": "In 10 healthy subjects and 10 duodenal ulcer patients the intestinal phase of gastric acid secretion was studied by intraduodenal infusion of a 10% liver extract meal (pH 7) at 400 ml/h for three hours. A gastroduodenal double lumen tube with two balloons was used to block the pylorus and to prevent duodenogastric reflux. Gastric acid response to a duodenal meal of liver extract reached a peak at the end of the first hour of infusion of the extract and was then followed by a relatively well-sustained plateau. When the figure was normalised as a percentage of peak response to pentagastrin it was about 45% in healthy subjects and 63% in duodenal ulcer patients. Serum gastrin concentration increased significantly during a duodenal meal of liver extract only in duodenal ulcer patients and not in healthy subjects. The combination of the duodenal meal of liver extract with pentagastrin infusion resulted in a significantly greater increase in acid output in duodenal ulcer patients than in healthy controls. Duodenal perfusion with a liver extract meal in which the pH was gradually decreased caused a pH-dependent reduction in acid output, but not in serum gastrin, both in the duodenal ulcer patients and in healthy subjects. This study shows that the intestinal phase in man results in a potent gastric acid stimulation which is pH-dependent, greatly augmented by pentagastrin, and more vigorous in duodenal ulcer patients than in healthy controls.",

    "input": "The neutralization of acid introduced into the duodenum has been found to be less intensive in patients with duodenal ulcer than in controls. The present work studied the possibility that chronic gastric hypersecretion injures the duodenal mucosa and thereby influences the neutralization system. Gastric hypersecretion was provoked for 3 weeks in 3 dogs by a daily injection of a gastrin preparation with prolonged effect. After a subcutaneous injection of this preparation given together with a test meal the acidity of both gastric and duodenal contents was found to increase significantly. After the 3 weeks of gastric hypersecretion the pancreatic bicarbonate response to exogenous secretin was unchanged, while the bicarbonate response to duodenal acidification was decreased from 2.03 mEq/30 min to 1.27 mEq/30 min (p less than 0.05), compatible with an impaired secretin release. Also the concentration of lactase, maltase, sucrase, and alkaline phosphatase in mucosal biopsies from the second part of the duodenum was significantly reduced (p less than 0.001). These results indicate that gastric hypersecretion causes mucosal damage in the duodenum and thereby reduces the release of secretin.",

This suggests an impairment in the secretin release system, which may be due to the mucosal damage caused by the chronic gastric hypersecretion."

In a double-blind controlled investigation, each volunteer was studied during four consecutive nights. In randomized order they received either 100, 200, or 300 mg of cimetidine or a placebo. No untoward clinical orlaboratory effects of the drug were found. Single-dose oral administration of 300 mg cimetidine caused a significant (P less than 0.05) inhibition of overnight gastric acid secretion for an 8-hr period, with the intragastric pH staying between 3.5-6.0. Cimetidine, because of its potent gastric acid inhibitory effect, may become an important therapeutic agent in the management of peptic ulcer disease.",

Pentagastrin, 1.5 microgram . kg-1 . h-1, was infused for 165 min, and cimetidine, 1.2 mg . kg-1 . h-1, was added by concomitant infusion during the last 90 min. The second secretion test was carried out 60 hours after the last dose of cimetidine. Acid and pepsin secretion, in response to pentagastrin stimulation, was not significantly changed after 6 weeks of daily cimetidine treatment. The response to pentagastrin plus cimetidine was, however, significantly higher at the end than at the start of the treatment period.

Acid output in response to the low dose of pentagastrin was on average 63% of the response to the high dose before and on average 65% after treatment. The corresponding values for pepsin output were on average 88% both before and after treatment. Thus, the parietal and chief cell sensitivity stayed unchanged after cimetidine treatment.

    "input": "We have studied the gastric response to an ordinary solid-liquid meal in 12 patients with active duodenal ulcer and 8 healthy volunteers. Our method employs gastric and duodenal markers to quantify acid, pepsin, and volume outputs in response to the meal, without manipulating intragastric pH. Intragastric volume, rate of gastric emptying, delivery of acid into the duodenum, and serum gastrin response were also measured simultaneously. On a separate day, peak acid output in response to betazole (1.5 mg per kg subcutaneously) was determined. Our results indicate an inappropriately prolonged gastric secretory response to meals in duodenal ulcer disease, without a concomitant increase in peak postprandial secretory rates or an increase in serum immunoreactive gastrin levels. Further, the stomach in duodenal ulcer disease did not \"retain\" the additional acid secreted in the later postprandial period, and abnormally high rates of acid delivery into the duodenum occurred. Our data are consistent with a dual defect in the duodenal mechanisms regulating both acid secretion and acid delivery into the duodenum.",

    "instruction": "What effect did cimetidine have on acid secretion when added to intravenous amino acid infusions?",
    "input": "The ability of an amino acid mixture given intraduodenally or intravenously to stimulate gastric secretion is compared in healthy subjects and in duodenal ulcer patients. Graded amounts of amino acids by both routes produced a similar increase in acid output in healthy subjects, reaching about 30% of the maximal response to pentagastrin. Serum gastrin concentrations remained virtually unchanged but serum alpha amino acid nitrogen levels were about twice as high with intravenous as with intraduodenal administration. Intravenously administered amino acids produced a significantly higher acid output in patients with duodenal ulcer than in healthy subjects, but did not produce a significant increase in gastric acid or pepsin secretion when combined with a pentagastrin infusion as compared with pentagastrin alone. Cimetidine (2 mg/kg/h) added to intravenous amino acid infusions caused almost complete suppression of acid secretion. This study indicates that amino acids are capable of stimulating gastric secretion after intraduodenal and after intravenous administration. The response to the latter is significantly higher in patients with duodenal ulcer than in healthy subjects, does not appear to involve gastrin release, is not affected by pentagastrin, and is strongly suppressed by histamine H2-blocker.",

Clinical investigations frequently lack the rigidly controlled conditions and the careful experimental designs usually found in preclinical animal studies, and this deficiency is partially attributable to the inherent complexities of clinical medicine. Consequently, a great deal of controversy results from conflicting interpretations, extrapolations and overextension of limited data that are often equivocal. More careful appraisal of data and increased awareness of the well-known pitfalls found in retrospective and prospective studies, in which biostatistical design and clinical relevance are often incompatible, are emphasized, and personal biases and the flagrant sensationalism expounded by the media are condemned. The clinician is cautioned to sift through the data, consider the benefit/risk ratio for each patient and then to subordinate the role of critical scientist and assume the role of physician, exercising good judgment in light of the existing evidence and the immediate problems at hand.",

It is of prime importance to define in advance exactly what you want to test and this may include not only the therapeutic and pharmacological effects and side-effects, the long-term neoplastic potential, the mutagenic effects and the effects on the foetus, but also mundane effects like credibility, acceptance, and even taste! Patient selection is not just \"Attention there Volunteers nos. 1,3,5,7,9,....step forward smartly from the left\". It is a complicated process in which there is inevitably some bias and our job is to see that any biases which are included do not bias the results, and that the results are understood to apply to this particular selection of patients and not to any other. Too many explicit exclusions therefore make results less useful because less widely relevant.",
    "output": "When defining what to test in the selection of patients for drug testing, several factors need to be considered. These include:\n\n1. Therapeutic and pharmacological effects: It is essential to understand how the drug works and its intended therapeutic benefits.\n\n2. Side-effects: It is crucial to identify any potential adverse reactions or side-effects that the drug may cause.\n\n3. Long-term neoplastic potential: This refers to the drug's potential to cause cancer or tumors over a prolonged period of use.\n\n4. Mutagenic effects: These are changes in the DNA that could potentially lead to genetic mutations.\n\n5. Effects on the foetus: If the drug is intended for use by pregnant women, it is important to understand its effects on the developing foetus.\n\n6. Credibility, acceptance, and taste: These factors are important for ensuring that the drug is acceptable to patients and can be easily administered.\n\n7. Bias: It is crucial to avoid subconscious bias in the selection of patients and to ensure that the results apply to the specific group of patients selected for testing.\n\n8. Relevance: Too many explicit exclusions may make the results less useful because they may not be widely applicable to other patient populations.\n\nIn summary, the selection of patients for drug testing should be a comprehensive process that considers a wide range of factors to ensure that the results are meaningful, applicable, and safe for the intended patient population."

Furthermore it is necessary to eliminate all factors of disturbance, which are able either to simulate or to mask a result of evaluation. The most important of these factors is the psychiatrist himself. Therefore, experimental designs have to taken in account the factor psychiatrist. Criteria of the effects of any drug must be relevant with regard to comparison of two or more drug effects. The reproduciability of criteria is very desirable, but a wish-fulfilment under the most circumstances.

    "output": "To investigate the rarity of adverse effects from the use of oral contraceptive pills, epidemiologic studies are necessary. These studies help gather and analyze data about health and disease in populations to understand the relationships between exposures, outcomes, and the distribution of those outcomes in the population.\n\nThere are different types of epidemiologic studies:\n\n1. Case Reports: These describe an uncommon response to a drug in a single patient. They serve as a starting point for further investigation.\n\n2. Case Series: This involves a small group of patients with the same or similar health problem. They can help identify patterns and trends but do not prove a causal relationship.\n\n3. Cross-Sectional Studies: These collect data at one point in time and compare different groups. They can help identify associations but do not prove cause and effect.\n\n4. Cohort Studies: These follow a group of people over time, comparing those who have received a particular treatment (the exposed group) with those who have not (the unexposed group). They can help establish a causal relationship.\n\n5. Case-Control Studies: These start with a group of patients with a particular disease (the cases) and a comparable group without the disease (the controls). They compare the frequency of exposure to a particular factor in the two groups. They can be quicker and cheaper than cohort studies but may be less reliable.\n\nIn the context of the rarity of adverse effects from oral contraceptive pills, larger studies such as cohort studies or case-control studies might be more appropriate to establish a causal relationship, if possible. However, interpretation of these studies can be challenging due to confounding factors and bias. Therefore, it's essential to have a clear understanding of the study design, population, and potential confounders when interpreting the results.\n\nUnited Kingdom doctors working in the field of contraceptive practice summarize the present position by emphasizing the need for further research to better understand the rarity of adverse effects from oral contraceptive pills and to improve the evidence base for clinical decision-making."

    "input": "To assess effectiveness of contraceptives, one reports all pregnancies during use. Multiple and single decrement life-table pregnancy rates computed from these reports constitute the fundamental measures of effectiveness in clinical trials. Minimally biased evaluation of a new method requires a randomized, double-blind (or its nearest semblance), multicentered study of sexually active women. New contraceptives are studied in special, volunteer populations. Evaluation of marketed contraceptives implies broader-gauged representation, larger numbers and longer time frames. Prospective studies, like clinical trials, should include several methods, and may use subsamples for case-control analysis of risk. Well-designed and executed multicentered, prospective studies, nevertheless, may represent specially selected populations. Risk-benefit analyses based on findings from selected populations require careful scrutiny. Although the most persuasive estimates of effectiveness derive from national, representative samples, moderately large samples in the USA have not been able to distinguish among products within a class. Formidable problems of recall are present in household surveys.

Although alpha-methylglucoside phosphate leaked from the cells at 50 degrees C, the concentration retained within the cells was about 500 times that externally, when only about 14% of the cells were viable. Overall, these results indicate that cells made nonviable by heating at 50 degrees C still have significant membrane integrity.",

    "instruction": "At what temperature does the second tryptophan residue become exposed to solvent?",
    "input": "The effect of heat on the conformation of bovine beta-lactoglobulin has been studied using intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy. Changes in the intensity, wave-length of maximum emission and emission peak width at half height of tryptophan fluorescence over the range 15-90 degrees C at pH 6.4-6.5 has allowed the environments of the two tryptophans in the molecule to be discriminated. At 20 degrees C both tryptophans are in hydrophobic environments. As the temperature is raised the conformation changes such that at about 50 degrees C one of the tryptophans is transferred to a more polar environment accessible to solvent. Conformational changes appear to be reversible if the protein is cooled to 20 degrees C after heat treatments up to 70 degrees C. Above 70 degrees C the second tryptophan residue becomes exposed to solvent. Complete exposure of one residue occurs at 80 degrees C while the other is still partially buried even at 90 degrees C. When the protein is then cooled to 20 degrees C the conformational changes appear to be irreversible with only one tryptophan residue returning to the hydrophobic interior of the molecule.",

    "instruction": "At what concentration of proteins does the apparent thermal stability of interferon become unstable even at low pH?",
    "input": "The loss of biological activity upon heating or agitation of human interferons is markedly altered by changing their aqueous environment. Low pH significantly stabilizes liquid fibroblast interferon at 68 degrees C and 37 degrees C whereas chaotropic salts stabilize at 68 degrees C but not at 37 degrees C; this anomalous result may be due to reactivation of biological activity at the higher temperature. The concentration of extraneous proteins influences the apparent thermal stability at any temperature and pH; thus, interferon was not stable even at low pH at protein concentrations less than 5 microgram/ml. Solutions of partially purified fibroblast interferon can be inactivated by mechanical stress; the addition of proteins or nonionic detergents prevents such inactivation. Freeze-dried preparations show the greatest thermal stability. The use of high-temperature, accelerated storage tests makes it possible to predict the shelf-life of freeze-dried interferon.",

    "input": "Heat production in human erythrocytes has been measured under different conditions of pH, glucose concentration, and temperature. Storage conditions have also been varied. The erythrocytes, which were from healthy subjects, were suspended either in autologous plasma or in phosphate buffer. The heat effect, P, was shown to increase linearly in the physiological pH range: 1.2% per 0.01 pH unit. Variation of the glucose concentration within a wide range, 3-32 mmol/1, did not affect the P value. The temperature coefficient for P was determined to be Q10 = 2.8 for the temperature range 32-42 degrees C. A constant energy of activation was found, 82.6 kJ/mol, for the temperature range 25-42 degrees C. When the erythrocytes were stored at 4 degrees C, P values (measured at 37 degrees C) increased initially by 6%/h. After 24 h of storage P was about 50% higher than the initial value. Determinations of glucose consumption were made in parallel with most of the calorimetric experiments.",

The initial period of adaptation revealed a decrease of the liver glycogen content and a relatively constant level of glycemia. A considerable activation of the carbohydrate digestion enzyme systems followed this lowering of energy resources. Metabolic regulatory mechanisms seem to take part in this activation which plays an adaptive role in maintenance of constant glycemia level under these stressful conditions.",

    "instruction": "What happens to the growth rate of the mutant cells when they are transferred to the nonpermissive temperature of 42 degrees C?",
    "input": "Temperature-sensitive conditional lethal mutants in phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (psd) accumulate large amounts of phosphatidylserine under nonpermissive conditions (42 degrees C) prior to cell death. In addition, the ratio of cardiolipin to phosphatidylglycerol is increased. At an intermediate temperature (37 degrees C), high levels of phosphatidylserine can be maintained with little effect on cell growth or viability. Under these conditions, both the rate of induction and the function of the lactose transport system are normal. At 42 degrees C addition of Mg2+ or Ca2+ to mutant cultures produces a partial phenotypic suppression. Growth is prolonged and the filaments normally present at 42 degrees C do not form. Upon transfer to the nonpermissive temperature, there is a considerable lag before accumulation of phosphatidylserine begins and the growth rate is affected. Based on the kinetics of heat inactivation of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity in extracts, in intact nongrowing cells, and in growing cells, it appears that the enzyme newly synthesized at 42 degrees C is more thermolabile in vivo than enzyme molecules previously inserted into the membrane at the lower temperature. Thus, the older, stable enzymatic activity must be diluted during growth before physiological effects are observed.",
    "output": "When the mutant cells are transferred to the nonpermissive temperature of 42 degrees C, the growth rate of the cells is affected. This is due to the accumulation of phosphatidylserine, a lipid that is normally maintained at low levels under permissive conditions (37 degrees C). At 42 degrees C, the increased levels of phosphatidylserine cause a considerable lag before accumulation begins, which in turn affects the growth rate of the cells. Additionally, the older, stable enzymatic activity of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, an enzyme essential for cell growth, is diluted during growth at 42 degrees C, making it less functional and contributing to the growth rate decrease."

    "instruction": "What temperature threshold distinguishes between the two separate effects of hyperthermia on mouse splenic lysosomes?",
    "input": "Two separate effects of hyperthermia on mouse splenic lysosomes have been reported, dependent on the severity of the treatment. Heating to temperatures below 42.5 degrees C causes a transient increase in lysosomal acid phosphatase activity which can be correlated with the ability of moderate hyperthermia to potentiate X-ray damage. Heating to temperatures above 42.5 degrees C results in an immediate increase in lysosomal membrane permeability which may be involved in tissue necrosis. By giving a priming heat treatment at 41.8 degrees C, induced thermal resistance was demonstrated for the lysosomal membrane effect, but not for the enzyme activation. The degree of induced thermal resistance observed is similar to that reported for the cell-killing effect of heat on tissues in vivo and cells in vitro and occurs over a similar time course. The relevance of these results to the understanding of fractionated hyperthermia in cancer therapy is discussed.",
    "output": "The temperature threshold that distinguishes between the two separate effects of hyperthermia on mouse splenic lysosomes is 42.5 degrees Celsius.

Completion of the referral was associated with being employed, not abusing drugs and alcohol, having a positive view of the walk-in clinic, and adherence to the medication regimen. Referral success was unrelated to sociodemographic characteristics, social integration, the nature of the intended disposition, or prior medical or psychiatric care. Patients who adhered to the disposition did not necessarily adhere to the medication regimen, and vice versa.

Most of these cells adhered rapidly to the substrate, did not replicate, displayed Fc receptor-dependent phagocytic activity, and were thus identified as macrophages. The remaining cells grew out into large islands comprised of one or two distinct morphologic types of mammary epithelial cells. Optimum growth of these cells was obtained in medium buffered to pH 6.8, and the epidermal growth factor markedly prolonged the exponential growth phase of the cells. Two morphologically distinct populations of epithelial cells were also observed in cultures established from individual breast tumors. Growth of the malignant cells was relatively unaffected by the pH of the culture medium, and the cells were unresponsive to exogenously added hormones. Overgrowth of malignant epithelial cells in primary cultures by stromal fibroblasts was retarded by replacement of standard growth medium with fresh medium containing a serum substitute; growth of the malignant epithelial cells was unaffected.

They stained intensely with antibodies against smooth muscle actin and myosin. Fibroblasts and endothelial cells did not stain with these antibodies thereby allowing the purity of each batch of cultures to be monitored. This was consistently found to be better than 99%. The smooth muscle cells modified or \"dedifferentiated\" after about 9 days in culture to morphologically resemble fibroblasts. At this stage cells could no longer be induced to contract and did not stain with the myosin antibodies. Intense proliferation of these cells soon resulted in a confluent monolayer being formed at which stage some differentiated characteristics returned. The modification of \"dedifferentiation\" process could be inhibited by the presence of a feeder layer of fibroblasts or endothelial cells, or the addition of cAMP to the culture medium. Smooth muscle cells which had migrated from explants in primary culture, and cells in subculture, had morphological and functional properties of \"dedifferentiated\" cells at all times.

By screening a variety of parameters, including media, sera, effusion fluids, feeder layers, and chemical supplements, the nutritive growth requirements of lymphoma cells obtained from malignant effusions and lymph node biopsies were determined for each tumor. Most of these cell lines initially required human skin fibroblast or epithelial cell feeder layers from which they could be weaned after one to six weeks in culture and maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute Tissue Culture Medium 1640 containing 20% fetal calf serum and 10% pooled human serum. Several of these cell lines were successfully cloned on 0.5% Noble agar substrates.

The Mg++-dependent ATPase activity in the plasma membrane was retained and the dense bodies with peroxidase activity were rarely observed at this stage. During the last seven days were prominent in the cells of the stratified layer. After 28 days in the culture, the cells began to round up and slough off the culture plate.",
    "output": "After 28 days in the culture, the cells began to round up and slough off the culture plate. This indicates that they started undergoing apoptosis or necrosis, which may be due to the cells reaching the end of their life span in culture or the culture conditions becoming less favorable for their growth and survival. Additionally, the formation of stratified layers of epithelial cells was prominent during the last seven days, but after 28 days, these cells started to die and detach from the culture plate."

    "input": "This research was performed to establish a cell line from experimental bladder tumor and to discuss the biological characteristics of the cell line so established. Tissue cultures of epithelial cells were derived from a rat bladder cancer induced by BBN. The cells showed loss of contact inhibition and the phenomenon of piling up after several subcultures. Colonial cloning was used. The population doubling time of the wild strain and the colonial clones was about 30 h. The chromosomal mode ranged from triploid to tetraploid to tetraploid. Plating efficiency was well below 20%. Intraperitoneal backtransplantation into newborn Wister rats resulted in tumors in all cases. These tumors, in some parts, resembled primary transitional cell carcinoma. The major tumor cell groups, however, showed marked keratinization and the picture of squamous cell carcinoma. The nucleus/cytoplasm ratio and the numbers of nuclei, free ribosomes and intracytoplasmic microfibrils were increased. Dense microvillus arrangements characterized the electron microscopic picture. During the mitotic phase, the cells became large and globular whereas the microvilli were relatively short and were gathered profusely over the whole surface. Cells in the gap 1-synthetic phase developed lamellipodia and pseudpodia-like cytoplasmic processes and were polygonal in shape. Microvilli were present in the central part containing the nucleus, but their numbers were somewhat decreased and their height increased (scanning electron microscopy).",

Incorporation into proinsulin-insulin showed a thirteenfold increase. The effect on other islet proteins was fourfold. Exposure of islets from normoglycemic rats to high glucose in vitro for twenty and ninety minutes and subsequent incubation with 3H-leucine at low glucose showed a twofold and fivefold increase in proinsulin biosynthesis. In the in vitro system pre-exposure of the islets to mannose and dibutyryl-cyclic AMP induced a much smaller increase in proinsulin biosyntheses.",

    "instruction": "What percentage of the tumour cells were estimated to be B cells based on the insulin content of the tumour?",
    "input": "The regulation of insulin biosynthesis, and insulin and glucagon secretion have been investigated in a human islet cell adenoma, by incubation of tumour fragments. Both biosynthesis and secretion of insulin were strongly stimulated by incubation of islet tumour cells in the presence of increasing glucose concentrations in the range 2-8 mmol/1. However, 20 mM-glucose or 20 mM-glucose plus isobutyl methylxanthine (IBMX), both of which provide potent secretagogues for normal B cells, failed to stimulate proinsulin biosynthesis and secretion from the tumour cells. Overall rates of secretion, expressed as a proportion of total insulin content, were up to 20-fold higher than those expected for normal pancreatic tissue. Glucagon secretion from the tumour was stimulated by low glucose concentrations; normal A cells also respond in this way under these conditions. However, no stimulation of glucagon secretion occurred in the presence of IBMX. There was therefore a major alteration in the regulation both of insulin and glucagon secretion, in that release of neither hormone was stimulated by cyclic AMP. Ultrastructural examination showed the tumour to be rather heterogeneous. A and B cells with normal storage granule content and structure were seen, as well as a rather larger number of B cells containing some granules of atypical appearance. The insulin content of the tumour (13 i.u./g wet wt) was consistent with 6-8% of the tumour cells being B cells.",
    "output": "The context provided suggests that the tumour cells were estimated to be 6-8% B cells based on the insulin content of the tumour. This estimation was made because B cells are known to produce insulin, and the insulin content of the tumour was found to be 13 I.U./g wet weight. Therefore, assuming that all insulin in the tumour was produced by B cells, we can estimate that 6-8% of the tumour cells were B cells. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate based on insulin content and may not perfectly reflect the actual percentage of B cells in the tumour due to factors such as the presence of atypical B cell granules."

The structural integrity of islets decreased progressively with time regardless of glucose concentration. Degeneration of islets was greatest after 60 minutes of incubation. The total amount of insulin released from cytologically intact mouse islets incubated with high glucose levels was always greater than that with low glucose except following 30 seconds of incubation when no difference was observed. Peaks of insulin secretion noted after 2 and 15 minutes of incubation were correlated with light microscopic and fine structural changes indicative of active secretion in beta-cells, i.e., degranulation, granule margination. At 5 and 30 minutes of incubation many beta-cells contained enlarged Golgi zones and abundant profiles of swollen rough endoplasmic reticulum containing pale, amorphous granular material presumably indicating insulin synthesis. Emphasis is placed on the desirability of correlating physiological and biochemical studies of isolated pancreatic islets with cytologic examination.",

    "input": "Isolated islets were continuously perifused with glucose to test their secretory capacity in a dynamic fashion, and were subsequently transferred to an incubation vial to measure their capacity for metabolizing glucose. Insulin release was measured by radioimmunoassay and metabolism of glucose by determining the rate of 3H2O formation from glucose tritiated on carbon atom 2 or 5 and by lactate accumulation. Insulin release was induced by glucose at a threshold of 5 mM, was half maximal at 8 mM, maximal at 15 mM and showed biphasic kinetics, which is consistent with published data. However, in contrast to most previous reports, utilization of glucose and lactate formation showed hyperbolic concentration dependency curves. Maximal and half maximal rates of glucose use were obtained at 30 and 8 mM, respectively, and lactate formation reached highest rates at 8 mM glucose. Physiological changes of glucose levels (from 5 to 10 mM) increased hormone release 4-fold (from 0.49 to 1.94 muU/islet/min) whereas glucose use was changed only slightly (from 52 to 75 pmol/islet/h), and lactate formation not at all. These data show that there is only limited association between metabolic and insulin releasing efficiency of glucose in pancreatic islets in vitro and also implicate and threshold phenomenon triggered by either a glucose metabolite or glucose itself.",

After washing the islets, (pro-)insulin release was stimulated by glucose in the presence or absence of exogenous insulin (up to 2-5 mu./ml). Hormone release was unchanged by the presence of exogenous insulin as judged by determination of both immunoreactive insulin and radioactivity incorporated into the proinsulin and insulin fractions of the medium.

    "instruction": "What was the percentage decrease in ATP level of mixed islets when glucose-free medium was perfused for sustained periods?",
    "input": "It has been suggested that the hyperglucagonemia observed in diabetic animals and man may be due to an impairment of glucose uptake and metabolism by the alpha-cells resulting in a decreased production of ATP. To test this hypothesis glucose, ATP, glucagon, and insulin were measured in pancreatic islets of normal and alloxan or streptozotocin diabetic rats. Two experimental approaches were used. In the first, the pancreas was perfused in vitro for assessing insulin and glucagon release due to 10 mM amino acids with and without 5 mM glucose. These perfusions were performed in the presence and absence of insulin. After perfusion, the pancreas was frozen and processed for analysis of islet glucose, ATP, insulin, and glucagon content. The second approach was to investigate the islet sucrose, urea, and glucose spaces together with ATP, insulin, and glucagon content in vivo in normal and in insulin-treated and untreated streptozotocin diabetic rats. Perfusion of the pancreas in vitro with 5 mM glucose resulted in higher glucose content of normal islets than in alloxan and streptozotocin diabetic islets. Similarly in the in vivo studies, the intracellular glucose space of the streptozotocin diabetic islets was 30% the value found in normals. In the in vivo experiments, despite the relatively small intracellular glucose space of alpha-cell islets, the ATP content of these islets was only 15-20% lower than the ATP content of normal islets. In the in vitro experiments, perfusion with glucose resulted in ATP contents of alpha-cell islets and of normal mixed alpha-beta-cell islets which were indistinguishable. However, the ATP content of alpha-cell islets was maintained for prolonged periods in the absence of glucose in contrast to mixed islets, composed primarily of beta-cells, in which the ATP level decreased by 45% when glucose-free medium was perfused for sustained periods. Finally, insulin infused in high concentrations or administered to the diabetic animal had no effect on the glucose spaces or the ATP contents of normal or alpha-cell islets. It can be calculated that in vivo the intracellular glucose level of islets from streptozotocin treated rats is approximately 15 mM. Since in normals an extracellular glucose concentration of this magnitude inhibits stimulated glucagon release completely, it would seem unlikely that a lack of intracellular glucose is the cause of the apparent glucose \"blindness\" of the alpha-cells in diabetes. In fact, in perfusion studies as little as 2.5 mM free intracellular glucose was sufficient to suppress glucagon secretion from diabetic alpha-cells. The results of the ATP measurements clearly eliminate a possible energy deficit of diabetic alpha-cells as cause of the apparent glucose resistance of alpha-cells.",

    "instruction": "What happened to the total islet phosphate content following exposure to stimulating concentrations of glucose and initiation of enhanced insulin release?",
    "input": "Isolated rat pancreatic islets were perifused and analyzed for phosphate content immediately following the transient increase in the efflux of orthophosphate which occurs when insulin secretion is stimulated by glucose. In some instances, islets were perifused directly following isolation to minimize preparative delay; in others, islets were prelabeled during incubation with [32P]orthophosphate for 90 min prior to perifusion. In both experimental situations, total islet phosphate content declined 40--50% following exposure to stimulating concentrations of glucose and initiation of enhanced insulin release. In the experiments with prelabeled islets, tissue content of [32P]orthophosphate fell to a similar extent so that the specific radioactivity of islet orthophosphate was unaffected. Inhibited of heightened insulin release with Ni2+ did not modify the decrements in total or radioactive tissue orthophosphate, thus indicating that these responses to islet stimulation reflect events which are proximal to activated exocytosis. Simultaneous analyses for tissue ATP and ADP demonstrated that the efflux in orthophosphate and reduction in tissue orthophosphate content were not mediated via net changes in islet adenine nucleotides. The observations represent the first documentation that a net reduction of tissue inorganic phosphate is one of the early components of stimulus-secretion coupling in isolated pancreatic islets.",
    "output": "The total islet phosphate content decreased by 40-50% following exposure to stimulating concentrations of glucose and initiation of enhanced insulin release. This reduction in phosphate content was observed in both situations - immediately following the transient increase in orthophosphate efflux after isolation and in prelabeled islets. The specific radioactivity of islet orthophosphate remained unchanged in prelabeled islets. The decrease in phosphate content was not mediated via net changes in islet adenine nucleotides (ATP and ADP). This indicates that the reduction in phosphate content is an early component of stimulus-secretion coupling in isolated pancreatic islets."

    "input": "The glucose responsiveness of alpha- and beta-cells of normal as well as untreated and insulin-treated streptozotocin diabetic rats was tested in the extracorporeal perfusion system. Also assessed was the possible in vitro effect of added insulin on the glucose sensitivity of islets from untreated diabetic animals. Insulin and glucose responsiveness of the two cell types. The rate of glucose entry islet tissue was estimated, and the effect of glucose on the tissue supply of ATP and lactate and the cyclic 3':5'-AMP level of islets was measured under the above in vitro conditions. It was demonstrated that beta-cells are more accessible to glucose than alpha-cells, that glucose entry into islet cells is not significantly modified by insulin and that glucose had no effect on ATP, lactate and cyclic 3':5'-AMP levels of islet tissue under any of the conditions investigated. High insulin in vitro elevated ATP levels of alpha-cell islets independent of extracellular glucose. Glucose caused insulin release from normal but not from diabetic islets and rapidly and efficiently suppressed stimulated glucagon secretion of the pancreas from normal and insulin treated diabetic rats. Glucose was less effective in inhibiting stimulated glucagon secretion by the pancreas from untreated diabetic rats whether insulin was added to the perfusion media or not. Therefore, profound differences of glucose responsiveness of alpha-cells fail to manifest themselves in alterations of basic parameters of glucose and energy metabolism in contrast to what had been postulated in the literature. It is however, apparent that the glucose responsiveness of alpha-cells is modified by insuling by an as yet undefined mechanism.",
    "output": "No, glucose did not cause insulin release from the islets of diabetic rats that were treated with insulin. In fact, glucose caused insulin release from normal but not from diabetic islets. This suggests that the insulin treatment may have impaired the ability of diabetic islets to respond to glucose stimulation.

    "input": "Isolated pancreatic islets obtained from spontaneously diabetic mice were recently shown to have a considerably reduced rate of insulin biosynthesis in response to glucose. This defect has now been further evaluated by in vitro measurements of the effects of glucose on the islet RNA metabolism. An increase of the glucose concentration from 3.3 mM to 16.7 mM more than doubled the incorporation of 3H-labelled uridine into the islet RNA in the normal mice. By contrast, no stimulation was observed in the diabetic mice. Electrophoretic separation, on polyacrylamide gels, of RNA from normal mouse islets indicated that glucose stimulated the incorporation mainly into RNA bigger than 4S. Furthermore the fraction of islet RNA which bound the poly (U) was stimulated in the normal mice but not in the diabetic animals. Taken together these findings indicate a deficient glucose regulation of the RNA metabolism in the diabetic mice which conforms to the previously reported low rate of insulin biosynthesis in response to glucose in these animals.",

However, no stimulation was observed in diabetic mice. This increase in normal mice primarily occurred in RNA bigger than 4S, and the fraction of islet RNA that bound to poly (U) was also stimulated.

At a concentration of 0.18 mM phloretin inhibited insulin release stimulated by glucose or leucine but did not affect the oxidation rates of glucose or leucine, the rate of glucose utilization and the islet content of ATP. Higher concentrations of phloretin caused inhibition of the rate of glucose metabolism, but stimulation of insulin release. Insulin release stimulated by phloretin was inhibited by mannoheptulose but was independent on extracellular Ca2+ and was not potentiated by caffeine. Both inhibitory and stimulatory effects of dextran-linked phloretin on insulin release were also seen; a concentration of dextran-linked phloretin that did not inhibit islet metabolism inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release, but not release stimulated by leucine or glyceraldehyde. Higher concentrations of dextran-linked phloretin inhibited glucose oxidation but stimulated insulin release. These data are discussed in terms of current models of the beta-cell glucose-sensor mechanism.",

To study their helper function, the harvested F1 T cells were transferred with antigen into irradiated F1 mice plus B cells from either the two parental strains or from F1 mice. F1 T cells activated in F1 mice gave high IgM and IgG anti-SRC responses with all three populations of B cells. By contrast, F1 T cells activated in mice of one parental strain collaborated well with B cells of this strain, but poorly with B cells of the opposite strain. Active suppression was considered an unlikely explanation for this result since (a) good responses were found with F1 B cells, and (b) addition experiments showed that the poor response with B cells of the opposite parental strain (which was equivalent to that produced by unprimed F1 T cells) could be converted to a high response by a supplemental injection of F1 T cells activated in F1 mice. The phenomenon (a) was specific for the antigen used for activation (criss-cross experiments were performed with horse erythrocytes), (b) was reflected in levels of serum hemagglutinins as well as in numbers of splenic plaque-forming cells, (c) applied also to comparable activation of (DBA/2 X C57BL/6)F1 T cells, and (d) could be prevented by activating F1 T cells in mice of one parental strain in the presence of peritoneal exudate cells of the opposite parental strain. The hypothesis was advanced that F1 T cells contain two discrete subpopulations of antigen-reactive cells, each subject to restrictions acting at two different levels: (a) during T-macrophage interactions and (b) during T-B collaboration. It was suggested that when F1 T cells are activated to antigen in a parental strain environment, radioresistant macrophages activate only one of the two subgroups of T cells, and this subgroup is able to collaborate with B cells of the strain used for activation (and with F1 B cells) but not with B cells of the opposite parental strain.

Administration of p-F gamma G coupled syngeneic cells specifically reduces both the primary and secondary hapten and carrier-specific PFC responses to TNP-F gamma G. Since the haptenic response is affected, the tolerance functions at the level of the F gamma G-specific helper T cell. As few as 10(3) p-F gamma G spleen cells carrying only 1 ng of p-F gamma G can induce tolerance. At least a 2-day-induction period is required. This nonresponsiveness is long lived, lasting over 120 days. Spleen cells from tolerized mice can transfer suppression to normal syngeneic recipients. Treatment of tolerant spleens with anti-Thy 1.2 antiserum + C eliminates the suppressor cell activity. In addition, thymocytes and purified splenic T cells from tolerized mice can transfer suppression to normal recipients.

With resolution of the infection by week 8, there was a shift of immunoregulatory function from dominant suppressor activity to expression of helper activity. At this time, delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to the above antigens were vigorous; furthermore, the cytotoxic activity and plaque-forming cell response of splenocytes from 8-week-infected mice were equal to or greater than normal control values.

At various time intervals after injection, the lymphocyte response, as measured by thymidine incorporation into DNA, and the number of immunoglobulin-secreting cells were determined in vitro before and after mitogenic stimulation with phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, or lipopolysaccharide. In unstimulated cultures, the spontaneous thymidine incorporation and immunoglobulin synthesis of spleen cells were increased to some extent in mice infected i.p. or i.v. with BCG, as compared with noninfected mice. In contrast, after mitogenic stimulation, a marked depression of the proliferative response of spleen cells to both T- and B-cell mitogens and a marked inhibition of LPS-induced immunoglobulin secretion were observed in mice infected i.v. and to a lesser extent in those infected i.p.

When unfractionated or plastic-adherent spleen cells from BCG-infected mice were cultured with normal spleen cells, a strong depression of their reactivity to phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, and lipopolysaccharide was observed. After the removal of cells adherent to plastic, the response was partially restored in the nonadherent population from mice infected i.p., but not in that from mice infected i.v.

    "input": "Spleen cells and serum from mice immunized with ectromelia virus suppressed the immune response to infectious virus when transferred intravenously into recipient mice given an immunizing virus dose. The suppression was reflected in decreased cytotoxic T-cell activity directed against H-2 compatible virus-infected target cells in the spleens of recipients. Suppression was observed when immune cells or serum were transferred 1-2 h or 1 day after immunization of recipients, but not 2 days after, and was maximal when 6-day immune spleen cells were used as suppressor cells. H-2 compatibility between donor and recipient mice was necessary for suppression to be expressed. Use of recombinant mice showed that I-region compatibility was neither sufficient nor necessary, and that D-region compatibility was sufficient. Specificity of suppression was suggested by the finding that cells and serum from mice immunized with Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterium, had no suppressive activity on the antiviral response. Anti-theta treatment eliminated the ability of immune cells to suppress, and the suppressive effect was not markedly dose-dependent with respect to both cell dose and virus dose under the conditions employed. Virus levels in the spleens of recipients were significantly reduced after injection of immune cells. Adult thymectomy had no effect on the primary immune response to ectromelia virus infection, thus indicating no role for T1 cells in the suppressive mechanism. The results obtained therefore suggested that suppression in this system was due to effector T cells which triggered clearance of virus (and thus, of virus-induced antigens) necessary for the induction of precursors of effector T cells, and that this simple feed-back mechanism normally plays an important role in the regulation of the primary immune response to ectromelia infection at the level of precursor induction. The existence of other postinduction regulatory mechanisms, however, is unknown and under investigation.",

Treatment of immune SC with the anti-T-serum (ATS) or the anti-B-globulin (ABG) and the complement considerably decreased or completely eliminated the suppressive activity. Administration of a mixture of two immune SC suspensions one of which was ATS- and another ABC-treated did not produce any suppression of the immune response in the intact recipients. It is supposed that the suppressor cells in the given model were T-lymphocytes expressing the antigens, common of cross-reacting with the B-cells.",

    "instruction": "How long after in vivo LPS treatment do the spleen cells from mice become fully functional again?",
    "input": "Spleen cells from mice injected with 2 to 50 microgram bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) have a reduced capacity to make an antibody response in vitro to trinitrophenylated sheep erythrocytes (TNP-SRBC) when tested 1 to 7 days later. Recovery is gradual, and these cells are full functional 2 weeks after in vivo LPS treatment. Unresponsiveness resides in the nonadherent splenic cell populations, and can be shown to have a suppressive cell component, which is irradiation sensitive and has somme characteristics of a thymus-derived lymphocyte (T cell). In addition, neither bone marrow-derived lymphocytes (B cells) nor T cells in the spleens of LPS-treated mice are functionally normal in their abilities to cooperate during an antibody response in vitro. LPS-B cells cooperated poorly with nylon wool-enriched T cells from normal mice but cooperated well with irradiated carrier-primed T cells or nylon wool-purified splenic T cells from carrier-primed mice. LPS-T cells have a reduced capacity to interact with normal B cells and appear to contain a suppressor cell component. These results indicate that the effects of exposure of immunocompetent cells to LPS are multifocal and can include suppression as well as stimulation of antibody formation.",

    "instruction": "What type of cells are responsible for the suppressor activity in the spleen cells from mice with tumor transplants?",
    "input": "Spleen cells from mice with syngeneic tumor transplants are hyporesponsive in mixed-lymphocyte culture. The hyporesponsiveness is due to the activation of suppressor cells. Spleen from tumor-bearing mice, treated with mitomycin and added to normal mixed lymphocyte culture (with responding cells syngeneic to the added cells), inhibits proliferation of the responding cells. Suppressor activity in the spleen cells can be detected as early as 5 days after s.c. transplantation of P-815 mastocytoma into DBA/2 mice. Tumor cells placed in cell-impermeable i.p. diffusion chambers can also activate splenic suppressor cells. Suppressor cells can be activated in syngeneic mice by (DBA/2) P-815 cells, by (C3H) L25-cells, or by recent (C57BL/6) methylcholanthrene-induced tumors. The latter tumors retain their ability to activate suppressor cells after passaging in syngeneic mice. Only one tumor, induced with methylcholanthrene in DBA/2 mice, failed to activate suppressor cells. Suppressor activity in the spleen cells from mice with 20-day s.c. tumor transplants is not reduced after removal of glass-adherent cells. Suppressor activity is significantly decreased after removal of thymus-derived cells with anti-theta treatment and complement.",
    "output": "The type of cells responsible for the suppressor activity in the spleen cells from mice with tumor transplants, as indicated in the context, are the thymus-derived cells. However, it's important to note that the context suggests these cells are not the only ones involved, as suppressor activity is not completely eliminated after removal of thymus-derived cells with anti-theta treatment and complement. Additionally, it's mentioned that other types of tumor cells can also activate suppressor cells, but the specific cell types within those tumors that are responsible for this activity are not specified in the context provided."

After repeated intradermal injections (adjuvant Ra) of neomycin, guinea pigs showed cross-sensitization to paromomycin, kanamycin, and streptomycin. A single intradermal injection of one of these antibiotics produced stronger reactions to the most closely related antibiotics, with no meaningful sensitization to the least-related allergens.

Lymph node cells from such desensitized animals 48 to 72 hr after the challenge showed a considerable reduction of the ability to produce blastogenic factor and skin reactive factor upon PPD-stimulation, whereas the macrophage migration inhibitory factor activity remained still unaffected. As regards antigen-induced 3H-thymidine incorporation in vitro, lymph node cells from animals desensitized in the late stage after sensitization showed no substantial reduction in the degree of enhanced DNA synthesis upon PPD-stimulation, although the desensitization in the early stage resulted in a significant loss of this activity. These results suggest the possibility that desensitizing challenge does not bring about a uniform and regular effect on every lymphocyte subpopulations relevant to different functions and, in addition, indicate that there are some exceptions to the compartmentalization concept of antigen-reactive lymphocytes.",

In order to localize the site of action of BP, cells from sensitized donors treated with BP one, two, three, or four times after disease onset have been transferred to normal recipients. One injection of BP has no effect on ability of cells to transfer EAE. Two injections partially inhibit transfer. After the third and fourth injections the sensitized cells lose their capacity to transfer EAE. The therapeutic effect of BP previously demonstrated in actively sensitized guinea pigs must involve the specifically sensitized cells rather than the target organ.",

    "input": "Production of neutralizing antibodies was followed in guinea pigs, rabbits, hamsters and mice immunized with crude antigen extracts (AM) from human diploid cells infected with herpes simplex virus type 1. The AM induced relatively high levels of neutralizing antibodies in all four species. The antibodies were predominantly complement-requiring and remained so even after administration of repeated AM doses. With the strains used, the antibody response was predominantly type specific and, surprisingly, the type specificity of sera usually increased after administration of repeated doses of AM. Guinea pigs seemed to be the best responsive animal species. They developed the highest levels of antibodies and complement-nonrequiring antibodies were seen in them earlier than in the other animal species. The dose-response experiments carried out in guinea pigs indicated that after a single dose administration the ratio between complement-requiring and complement-nonrequiring antibodies was dependent on the amount of antigen administered. When AM was given without adjuvant less efficient antibody production wws observed than after the administration of the same amount of antigen with adjuvant.",
    "output": "In the context provided, when AM was given without adjuvant, the efficiency of antibody production was observed to be less compared to when it was given with adjuvant.

    "input": "Immune complex- and T cell-mediated reactions to organic antigens appear to contribute to the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis in humans. Because pigeon serum is one of the reagents used by clinicians to diagnose this disease, we assessed its potential to elicit immune complex-mediated pulmonary inflammation in guinea pigs. Animals were immunized with different concentrations of pigeon serum protein emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant, and serums were collected at 4-day intervals after the booster injection. The largest amounts of tissue-fixing (IgG1) and complement-fixing (IgG2) antibodies to pigeon serum were detected in guinea pigs immunized with 1.0 mg of pigeon serum protein 20 to 24 days after the secondary immunization. Therefore, the responses of these animals and of recipients of serum from these animals to aerosol challenge with either homologous (pigeon serum) or heterologous (bovine gamma globulin) immunogen was investigated. Actively and passively immunized guinea pigs developed pulmonary inflammation only after exposure to aerosolized pigeon serum. However, lesions were not observed in the lungs of complement-deficient recipients of immune serum that had inhaled homologous immunogen. These observations suggest that such pigeon serum-elicited pulmonary inflammation in guinea pigs is a manifestation of a complement-dependent, humoral-immune mechanism of pathogenesis and thus is consistent with an immune complex disease.",

    "input": "Exposure of rat brain Na+ + K+-ATPase (ATP phosphohydrolase E.C. 3.6.1.3) to concentrations of cassaine greater than 1 x 10(-4) M resulted in a poorly reversible inhibition of this enzyme. Inhibition did not require the presence of ATP and developed rapidly, but the final amount of inhibition observed was independent of time. The amount of inhibition observed at a given concentration of cassaine was reduced by increasing the concentration of membranes in the system. The inhibition of Na+ + K+-ATPase activity was associated with equivalent inhibition of the phosphorylation and (3H)-ouabain binding reactions of this enzyme, while the uninhibited enzyme was apparently kinetically normal. Concentrations of cassaine which produced this stable inhibition of Na+ + K+-ATPase had no effect on the Mg2+-activated ATPase or the NADH cytochrome-c-reductase activities of crude rat brain microsomal preparations. Cassaine inhibited the cholinesterase activity of rat brain microsomes with a Ki of about 5 x 10(-5) M, but his inhibition was fully reversible. The poorly reversible inhibitory actions of cassaine, thus, appeared specific for Na+ + K+-ATPase. Because this stable pattern of inhibition of the Na+ + K+-ATPase by cassaine required drug concentrations at least one hundred-fold greater than those which produce positive inotropic effects, it appears unlikely that this pattern of Na+ + K+-ATPase inhibition is involved in the cardiotonic actions of this drug.",

    "input": "Antibodies which were raised against highly purified membrane-bound (Na+ -K+)-ATPase from the outer medulla of rat kidneys inhibit the (Na+-K+)-ATPase activity up to 95%. The antibody inhibition is reversible. The time course of enzyme inhibition and reactivation is biphasic in semilogarithmic plots. In the purified membrane-bound (Na+-K+)-ATPase negative cooperativity was observed (a) for the ATP dependence of the (Na+ -K+)-ATPase activity (n = 0.86), (b) for the ATP binding to the enzyme (n = 0.58), and (c) for the ouabain inhibition of the (Na+ -K+)-ATPase activity (n = 0.77). By measuring the Na+ dependence of the (Na+ -K+)-ATPase reaction, a positive homotropic cooperativity (n = 1.67) was found. As reactivation of the antibody-inhibited enzyme proceeds very slowly (t0.5 = 5.2 hr), it was possible to measure characteristics of the antibody-(Na+ -K+)-ATPase complex: The antibodies exerted similar effects on the ATP dependence of the (Na+ -K+)-ATPase reaction and on the ATP binding of the enzyme. Vmax of the (Na+ -K+)-ATPase reaction and the number of ATP binding sites were reduced while K0.5 ATP for the (Na+ -K+)-ATPase activity and for the ATP binding were increased by the antibodies. The Hill coefficients for the ATP binding and for the ATP dependence of the enzyme activity were not significantly altered by the antibodies. The antibodies increased the K0.5 value for the Na+ stimulation of the (Na+ -K+)-ATPase activity, but they did not alter the homotropic interactions between the Na+-binding sites. The negative cooperativity which was observed for the ouabain inhibition of the (Na+ -K)-ATPase activity was abolished by the antibodies. The data are tentatively explained by the following model: The antibodies bind to the (Na+ -K+)-ATPase from the inner membrane side, reduce the ATP binding symmetrically at the ATP binding sites and reduce thereby also the (Na+ -K+)-ATPase activity of the enzyme. The antibodies may inhibit the ATP binding by a direct interaction or by means of a conformational change at the ATP binding sites. This may possibly also lead to the alteration of the Na+ dependence of the (Na+ -K+)-ATPase activity and to the observed alteration of the dose response to the ouabain inhibition.",
    "output": "The half-time for the reactivation of the antibody-inhibited (Na+ -K+)-ATPase enzyme is 5.2 hours. This means that it takes 5.2 hours for half of the enzyme activity to return after inhibition by the antibodies."

    "input": "Most biological membranes are functionally asymmetric. To study biochemical control of cardiac transsarcolemmalion fluxes, it would be of obvious advantage to use isolated vesicles of sarcolemma which retains the low passive permeability characteristics of intact sarcolemma because in such vesicles the membrane should exhibit its normal asymmetric character with respect to enzymic activities. The purpose of this investigation was to attempt identify such vesicles in a cardiac microsomal (membrane vesicular) preparation. We studied activation by Na+ and K+ of Na+, K+-ATPase and its associated K+-phosphatase activities, using as substrates ATP or p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) in the presence of Mg2+. Optimal concentrations of K+ alone (10 mM) stimulated p-nitrophenylphosphatase (pNPPase) activity 1.8-fold, and over 80% of the increase could be inhibited by ouabain. Optimal Na+ plus K+ concentrations (100 mM and 10 mM, respectively) stimulated the rate of ATP hydrolysis 2-fold, but only 11 +/- 1.1% of the increased activity was ouabain-sensitive. Optimal pretreatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (0.3 mg/ml) rendered both activities completely sensitive to inhibition by ouabain and reduced the basal Mg2+-ATPase activity by 70-90%. The K+-stimulated pNPPase activity doubled after preincubation in SDS, but the ATPase activity stimulated by Na+ plus K+ fell by 50% under these conditions. A similar pattern of apparent activation was produced by preincubation with deoxycholate (DOC), except that basal Mg2+-dependent activities were resistant to destruction by this detergent. The incremental responses to activation by ions and substrates, and inhibition by oubain, are consistent with the hypothesis that permeability-intact vesicles of sarcolemma are present in the isolated preparation, and that detergent activation renders the vesicles highly permeable to the ions, substrates, and ouabain.",

In some preparations vanadium was found to be the most potent inhibitor of Na+  + K+ATPase activity so far reported. Concentrations of vanadium causing 50 percent inhibition of Na+ + K+ATPase activity ranged from 6 x 10(-8) to 5 x 10(-7) M in microsomal fractions and from 2 x 10(-7) to 1 x 10(-6) M in tissue homogenates. Renal and cardiac enzymes were more sensitive to vanadium than the brain enzyme, a phenomenon independent of enzyme specific activity. The enzyme in tissue homogenates was more resistant to vanadium than the microsomal enzyme derived from the same tissues, suggesting a presence in tissues of protective agents. Mg2+ ATPase, which contaminated the enzyme preparations to a variable degree, was 1,000-10,000 times more resistant to vanadium than was Na+ + K+ATPase. More detailed studies on the mechanism of inhibition were performed with dog and human kidney enzymes. The reversible nature of the inhibition was suggested by the fact that fractional inactivation of Na+ + K+ATPase by vanadium was independent of enzyme protein concentrations. The inhibitory effect was reduced by Na+ and increased by K+ or Mg2+. ATP alone, but not MgATP, antagonized the inhibition. This could mean that vanadium inhibits the Na+ + K+ATPase at the site activated by Na+, and that ATP protects the enzyme either by binding vanadium or by competing for a mutual receptor on the enzyme. The inhibition was reduced by bovine serum albumin, probably binding vanadium. The inhibition was also diminished by reducing agents, ascorbic acid and citric acid.",

The enzyme activity, ANS binding, and ANS-enzyme fluorescence were decreased by phospholipase A, phospholipase C, and trypsin treatments. Although ouabain inhibited enzyme activity and ANS-enzyme fluorescence markedly, it caused only a slight depression in ANS binding.

    "input": "In human red cell membranes the sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide of Ca2+-dependent ATPase and phosphatase activities is at least ten times larger than the sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase and K+-activated phosphatase activities. All activities are partially protected against N-ethylmaleimide by ATP but not by inorganic phosphate or by p-nitrophenylphosphate. (ii) Protection by ATP of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase is impeded by either Na+ or K+ whereas only K+ impedes protection by ATP of K+-activated phosphatase. On the other hand, Na+ or K+ slightly protects Ca2+-dependent activities against N-ethylmaleimide, this effect being independent of ATP. (iii) The sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide of Ca2+-dependent ATPase and phosphatase activities is markedly enhanced by low concentrations of Ca2+. This effect is half-maximal at less than 1 micron Ca2+ and does not require ATP, which suggests that sites with high affinity for Ca2+ exist in the Ca2+-ATPase in the absence of ATP. (IV) Under all conditions tested the response to N-ethylmaleimide of the ATPase and phosphatase activities stimulated by K+ or Na+ in the presence of Ca2+ parallels that of the Ca2+-dependent activities, suggesting that the Ca2+-ATPase system possesses sites at which monovalent cations bind to increase its activity.",

The percentage of inhibition of Na+,K+-activated activity by ouabain (8 x 10(-5) M) varied in the subcellular fractions; it was higher in the guinea-pig (range 31--87%) than in the rat (nonsignificant effect to 40%). A greater percentage of total Na+K+- activated ATPase activity was inhibited in the vas deferens of the guinea pig (56%) than the rat (30%). Differences in the effects of lowered extracellular potassium concentration or ouabain on resting membrane potential (preceding paper) are apparently unrelated to the amount of transport enzyme in the vasa deferentia or the two species, or to its relative sensitivity to ouabain.",

    "input": "A density gradient-purified microsomal membrane preparation from rabbit fundic gastric mucosa was used for a detailed study of the K+-stimulated ATPase and associated intermediate reactions. Membranes incubated with gamma-[32P]ATP show the rapid incorporation of 32P into phosphoprotein. Phosphoprotein levels were markedly reduced (1) when ATP hydrolysis went to completion or (2) upon addition of unlabeled ATP, thus suggesting the participation of a rapid turnover phosphorylated intermediate in the gastric microsomal ATPase. Addition of K+, Rb+ or Tl+ greatly reduced the level of the intermediate while stimulating ATPase activity; the observed affinities of these cations were similar for the effects on both ATPase and intermediate levels, with Tl+ greater than K+ greater than Rb+. Neither ATPase nor intermediate were stimulated by Na+, and ouabain was without effect on the reactions, thus differentiating this system from the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase. Addition of various inhibitors showed differential effects on the partial reactions of the gastric ATPase system. N-ethylmaleimide and Zn2+ showed characteristics of completely abolishing the K+-stimulated component of ATPase as well as the effects of K+ in reducing the level of intermediate, thus suggesting that these agents exert their inhibitory effect on a phosphoprotein phosphatase partial reaction. F- abolished the K+-stimulated ATPase, but its more complex effects on the intermediate suggested an additional reaction step within the domain of the phosphorylated intermediate. Results are consistent with a model system for the gastric microsomal ATPase involving a Mg2+-dependent protein kinase, a phosphorylated intermediate(s), and a K+-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphatase.",
    "output": "The addition of Na+ did not have any stimulatory effect on the ATPase activity or the levels of the intermediate in the gastric microsomal ATPase system. In contrast, K+, Rb+, and Tl+ were found to reduce the level of the intermediate while stimulating ATPase activity. This suggests that Na+ does not participate in the same mechanism as these cations in this ATPase system, which is different from the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase. The inhibitors N-ethylmaleimide and Zn2+ were found to abolish the K+-stimulated component of ATPase and also the effects of K+ in reducing the level of intermediate, suggesting they inhibit a phosphoprotein phosphatase partial reaction. F- also inhibited the K+-stimulated ATPase, but its effects on the intermediate were more complex, indicating an additional reaction step within the domain of the phosphorylated intermediate."

SF was characterized by different steps of separation using centrifugation, dialysis and salt-fractionation. For demonstration of the SF animals were sensitized with SRBC and given different substrates separately. The stimulation of the antibody-production was demonstrated on the cellular level using the plaque-technique. SF was detected by comparing the counts of plaque-forming cells in the spleen of treated mice compared with controls merely sensitized or given the same substrate of normal animals.

Placentas were a reliable source of active material, and one placenta provided enough material to stimulate 5,000-10,000 cultures of normal or leukemic cells. The colony-stimulating factor in human placental conditioned medium (CSFHPCM) was concentrated and purified 1800-fold using ammonium sulfate precipitation, calcium phosphate gel absorption, DEAE-cellulose batch absorption, gel filtration on Sephadex G-150, and polyarcylamide gel gel electrophoresis. The active factor behaved on gel filtration as a macromolecule with an apparent molecular weight of 30,000 daltons. The active factor in placental conditioned medium was not dependent on the presence of adherent marrow cells with endogenous colony-stimulating activity.",

    "input": "Partially purified lymphocytic factors were obtained from boving spleen; these factors are non-cytotoxic and biologically active in vitro and in vivo: [3H]Thymidine incorporation into DNA of mitogen-stimulated mouse spleen cells in culture is inhibited; similar results are obtained with phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral human lymphocytes, where blast cells transformation is blocked. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into DNA of mitogen stimulated lymphocytes withdrawn from in vivo treated mice, is also reduced. The two factors in vitro and in vivo seem to act preferentially on mouse spleen cells compared to their action on liver, kidney and testicle cells in cluture, as far as thymidine incorporation into DNA is concerned. The following techniques were applied for their purification: 1. Homogenization of the fresh tissue in water, centrifugation, dialysis of the supernatant, centrifugation, fractionation of the supernatant by alcoholic precipitation and finally concentration in vacuo and lyophilization of the material soluble at 75% of alcohol yielded fraction F. 2. Preparation of an acetone powder from the spleen, extraction of the dry powder with water, then high speed centrifugation, followed by lyophilization of the supernatant produced fraction F'. Both fractions F and F' were further fractionated by chromatography on a Sephadex G75 column: 7 peaks were obtained (F1--F7). Biological activity was found in fraction F1, corresponding to high molecular weight material, and in  fraction F6, corresponding to low molecular weight substances.

    "instruction": "What is the isoelectric point of the molecules identified as products of activated guinea pig lymphocytes?",
    "input": "Activated lymphocytes release numerous products which are either synthesized de novo or in increased amounts; some of these products play a role in the regulation of the immune response and are designated as mediators of cellular immune reactions or lymphokines. The first lymphokine described was the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) which has been studied most extensively with regard to its chemical and biological properties. Using sensitive radiolabelling techniques and an antiserum against highly purified fractions of MIF we were able to identify several products of activated guinea pig lymphocytes with different molecular weights of 15.000, 30.000, 45.000, 60.000 which all had an isoelectric point of 5.2 and were all inhibitory to macrophage migration. It is suggested, that these molecules are oligomers of a common subunit of molecular weight 15.000. It was further shown, that molecules of the same physical-chemical and serological characteristics are produced by activated B-cells, L2C leukemia cells and growing fibroblasts, thus further substantiating earlier reports on the production of MIF by lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. The described molecules were also shown not to contain determinants of the major histocompatibility complex and to be distinct from lymphotoxin, another lymphocyte activation product. It is concluded, that MIF is not a single molecule but rather a system of structurally related molecules. Their interaction with macrophages and possible relationships to macrophage activating factor is discussed.",

Other macrophage activators including latex microspheres, antigen-antibody complexes, and barium sulfate induce the production of LAF. There is a delay of 6 hr before significant amounts of LAF activity appear in the supernatant medium and maximum activity is found after 12 to 24 hr. Chromatography of concentrated crude supernatant fractions containing LAF activity on Sephadex G-100 gave two peaks of activity (approximately 85,000 and 13,000 daltons). The latter constitutes the major activity and has been purified at least 500-fold with Sephadex G-100, anion exchange, and adsorption chromatography. Optimal stimulation with LAF induces mitosis in 10% of murine thymocytes. The purified activity is sensitive to chymotrypsin and is not affected by treatment with sodium periodate, sulfhydryl reagents, and phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride. The response of thymocytes to LAF decreases with age after 10 weeks and thymocytes obtained from animals injected with cortisone or tumor-bearing animals have an increased responsiveness to LAF.",

    "input": "Serum-free conditioned medium from human lung obtained at autopsy provides a rich source of colony stimulating factor which stimulates granulocytic and macrophagic colony growth in both mouse and human bone marrow. The appearance of the factor is enhanced by endotoxin and inhibited by either puromycin or actinomycin D. Human lung colony stimulating factor is stable at the pH range of 6.5-10 and temperature of 56 degrees C for 30 min. It is resistant to trypsin and neuraminidase but is sensitive to subtilisin, chymotrypsin and periodate. It shows heterogeneity on Sephadex gel filtration with two activity peaks having molecular weight of 200 000 and 40 000, respectively. Upon gel electrophoresis, human lung colony stimulating factor migrates in the alpha-globulin post-albumin region. Using the combination procedures of hydroxyapatite chromatography and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis a 600-fold purification was achieved with a final specific activity of 6-10(5) units per mg protein. The purified colony stimulating factor is very labile; however, the activity can be stabilized by the addition of gelatin or bovine serum albumin at the concentration of 0.1% and 0.2 mg/ml, respectively.",

    "input": "Colony-stimulating factor, which specifically stimulates mouse bone marrow cells to proliferate in vitro and generate colonies of granulocytes, or macrophages, or both, was purified 3500-fold from mouse lung-conditioned medium. Analysis by discontinuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence and absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated that there was a single protein component. All of the colony-stimulating activity was coincident with the protein band. The molecular weight of colony-stimulating factor estimated by gel filtration was approximately 29,000 and by electrophoresis approximately 23,000. The specific activity of purified colony-stimulating factor from mouse lung-conditioned medium bound to concanavalin A-Sapharose, indicating that it is a glycoprotein. The small percentage of colony-stimulating factor in mouse lung-conditioned medium which did not bind to concanavalin A-Sepharose appeared to represent molecules which lacked the carbohydrate moieties required for binding to this lectin. It was necessary to include low concentrations (less than 0.01%, v/v) of polymers such as gelatin and polyethylene glycol, or nonionic detergents such as Triton X-100, in all of the buffers used throughout the purification scheme, otherwise colony-stimulating factor was lost from solution. At high concentrations (greater than 20 mug/ml) the factor stimulated the formation of granulocytic, macrophage, and mixed colonies from C57BL mouse bone marrow cells. As the concentration of purified colony-stimulating factor was decreased, the frequency of colonies containing granulocytes also decreased. At low concentrations of colony-stimulating factor (less than 70 pg/ml) only macrophage colonies were stimulated.",

Gel filtration indicates a molecular weight of 45,000 which is unchanged following treatment with insolubilized trypsin, a procedure which affords a useful purification (240-fold). Trypsin-sensitive material in CSF preparations modifies colonial form under certain conditions of culture, probably by increasing the motility of macrophages.

Using a new assay which measured neutrophil-induced inhibition of uptake of [(14)C]cytosine by Candida, damage to Candida in the absence of serum was 53.04+/-2.96% by neutrophils from 27 normal subjects. With serum, damage to Candida increased because of opsonization by low levels of anti-Candida immunoglobulin G in normal sera. Damage to Candida was inhibited by colchicine, cytochalasin B, and 2-deoxyglucose, which interfered with spreading of neutrophils over the surfaces of Candida. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP, theophylline, and isoproterenol also inhibited damage to Candida. Hydrocortisone was inhibitory in levels (10 muM) achievable with pharmacologic doses in man. Light, fluorescence, and electron microscopy indicated that neutrophils degranulated after contact with Candida. Quantitative studies revealed only a minimal increase in specific release of lysosomal enzymes from azurophil granules, but much greater release of lysozyme from specific granules. Candida activated neutrophil oxidative microbicidal mechanisms, as shown by iodination of Candida by neutrophils, and chemiluminescence from neutrophils interacting with Candida. Unlike live Candida, killed Candida did not induce chemiluminescence, were not iodinated, and did not attach to neutrophils by microscopy. Like Candida pseudohyphae, contact between neutrophils and hyphal forms of Aspergillus and Rhizopus occurred in the absence of serum. This did not occur with Cryptococcus neoformans, an encapsulated yeast, and was low with Candida yeasts. These findings indicate that neutrophils can recognize and attach to Candida pseudohyphae, then damage the Candida. This may represent a general reaction between neutrophils and large forms of fungi. Though the size of the organisms precludes complete ingestion, neutrophil oxidative microbicidal mechanisms are activated, and preferential release of contents of specific granules appears to occur.",
    "output": "In the absence of serum, the ability of neutrophils to attach to and damage Cryptococcus neoformans, an encapsulated yeast, is significantly lower compared to Candida pseudohyphae. This is because the interaction between neutrophils and Cryptococcus neoformans is less pronounced, as observed in the context provided. The reason for this difference isn't explicitly stated in the context, but it could be due to the different structural characteristics of these fungi, with Candida pseudohyphae being more susceptible to neutrophil attack."

    "instruction": "What type of compounds were observed to have exceptionally high potencies in inhibiting B. subtilis?",
    "input": "The inhibition of cell duplication by many lipophilic acids was measured in Bacillus subtilis and in the following mammalian cell lines, the human epithelial-type cell lines HeLa, strain R and strain L-132, the human fibroblast cell line VA-13, and the rat glial cell line C. The results were correlated to the partition coefficient and the distribution coefficient (= apparent partition coefficient at pH 7.2) of the compounds, using octanol/water partition coefficients and pKa values either from the literature or measured for this work. For B. subtilis, the logarithm of the inhibitory potency of most compounds increases linearly with the logarithm of the partition coefficient. Exceptional high potencies were observed for compounds that can efficiently delocalize the charge of the negative ion over the whole molecule. Most compounds inhibit tissue cultures at least as potently as they inhibit B. subtilis. But some compounds are significantly more potent in tissue cultures than would have been expected from the B. subtilis data; such compounds (analgesics/antipyretics, anti-inflammatory compounds, butyrate, norepinephrine) presumably inhibits mammalian cells by specific reactions with certain cell components. However, most compounds inhibit the different cell lines to a similar degree, indicating no cellular specificity; exceptions to this rule are chlorambucil, chlortetracycline and dexamethasone. Many of the lipophilic acids that are potent inhibitors of mammalian cell replication are also teratogenic. Exceptional compounds may not reach the embryo. We propose that a number of other lipophilic acids that are potenta inhibitors and to which humans are frequently exposed should be tested for their teratogenic effect.",

    "input": "The effects of staphylococcal products as chemo-attractants for human blood neutrophils and monocytes and as inhibitors of locomotion of these cells were studied with bacterial cells, culture filtrates and isoelectrically focused fractions from culture filtrates of nine strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Little direct chemotactic activity of staphylococcal products for neutrophils was observed, although a chloroform-soluble extract of the whole organisms contained such activity. The major chemotactic effect of staphylococci for neutrophils was indirect, i.e., generated when the organisms or their products were incubated with plasma, perhaps due to activation of complement. In contrast, direct chemotactic activity for monocytes was found in a large number of staphylococcal fractions. Staphylococci also produced inhibitors of locomotion of both neutrophils and monocytes. Isoelectric focusing showed more fractions inhibitory for neutrophils than for monocytes. Some of the inhibitors could be identified. Staphylococcal alpha-toxin inhibited migration of both neutrophils and monocytes. Sphingomyelinase C (beta toxin) inhibited migration of monocytes but not of neutrophils. Leucocidin-rich strains were strongly active as inhibitors of neutrophil locomotion but less so as inhibitors of monocyte locomotion.",

    "input": "The relationship between phagocytosis and bactericidal action of polymorphonuclear leukocytes was examined by comparing the functions of cytochalasin D-treated leukocytes with those of the control. Measurement of phagocytotic and bacterial DNA-degrading activities using Escherichia coli prelabeled with [3H]thymidine revealed that phagocytosis and bacterial DNA degradation were inhibited by treatment with cytochalasin D to about 50 and 10% of the control, respectively. Nevertheless, the bactericidal activity of the cytochalasin D-treated leukocytes was almost the same as that of the control leukocytes; almost all the bacteria were phagocytized by the latter leukocytes. Under the same experimental conditions, the production and release of superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide, which are both known to be involved in the bactericidal action of the leukocytes, were markedly increased by cytochalasin D. Release of several lysosomal hydrolases was also increased markedly by cytochalasin D treatment, except for myeloperoxidase. However, lactate dehydrogenase, a typical cytosolic marker, was not released by the same treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that the increase in the release of the above-mentioned bactericidal factors was due to decomposition of the leukocytes. These results indicate that the site of bactericidal action of cytochalasin D-treated leukocytes is not necessarily intracellular but may be around the external surface of the cells.",

    "input": "The lytic and bactericidal actions of polymyxin B on whole cells and spheroplasts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa varied markedly with the suspending media, and there was little correlation between them. Relative rates of lysis of these preparations and also of Bacillus megaterium protoplasts suggested that polymyxin causes progressive damage to the cytoplasmic membrane, such that membrane permeability towards various ions increased as follows: K(+) > Na(+) > NO(3) (-) > Cl(-), Ca(2+), H(2)PO(4) (-)/HPO(4) (2-). Impermeant compounds, such as NaCl and sucrose, protected whole cells against lysis but not against death. It is suggested that lysis of whole cells by polymyxin is a secondary effect, resulting from entry of solutes normally excluded by the cytoplasmic membrane and the fragility of the damaged outer membrane. Because the degree of lysis varies with the external solutes, it should be treated with caution as a descriptor of polymyxin activity.",
    "output": "Treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with polymyxin B increases the membrane permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane towards various ions, with potassium ions (K+) being the most affected, followed by sodium ions (Na+), nitrate ions (NO3-), chloride ions (Cl-), calcium ions (Ca2+), and phosphate ions (H2PO4-/HPO4(2-)). This increase in permeability is likely a result of progressive damage to the cytoplasmic membrane, leading to a higher influx of solutes that are normally excluded by the membrane. The outer membrane also becomes fragile due to this damage, which could potentially lead to lysis of the whole cells. However, it's important to note that lysis is a secondary effect and the degree of lysis can vary with the external solutes, so it should be used with caution as a descriptor of polymyxin activity."

    "instruction": "What was the effect of untreated zymosan and native IgG on O-.2 production and lysosomal enzyme release in polymorphonuclear leukocytes?",
    "input": "Human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes, when exposed to appropriate stimuli, generate significant amounts of superoxide anion (O-.2), a highly reactive molecule which is possibly involved in bacterial killing. Since the subcellular localization and mechanism of activation of O-.2 generating systems are unknown, we have investigated superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction (attributable to O-.2) by, and lysosomal enzyme release from, normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes and cells rendered incapable of ingesting particles by treatment with cytochalasin B. Neither phagocytosis nor lysosomal degranulation were prerequisites for enhanced O-.2 generation. Cytochalasin B-treated cells exposed to (a) serum-treated zymosan, a C3b receptor stimulus; (b) heat aggregated human IgG, an Fc receptor stimulus; and (c) the complement component, C5a, generated enhanced amounts of O-.2 in a time and concentration-dependent fashion. These cells also responded by releasing lysosomal enzymes, but there was no correlation between the ability of any immune reactant to provoke enzyme release and its ability to stimulate O-.2 generation. The three stimuli also enhanced O-.2 generation by normal (untreated) polymorphonuclear leukocytes, but only serum-treated zymosan and aggregated IgG were capable of provoking lysosomal enzyme release from normal cells. Untreated zymosan and native IgG neither stimulated O-.2 production nor provoked lysomal enzyme release. Since enhanced O-.2 production was stimulated by immune reactants in the absence of phagocytosis, the O-.2 generating system is very likely associated with the external plasma membrane of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte. Leukocyte membrane receptors for complement and immunoglobulins may therefore not only serve in particle recognition but also may initiate biochemical events which accompany phagocytosis and killing.",
    "output": "Untreated zymosan and native IgG did not stimulate the production of superoxide anion (O-.2) or provoke lysosomal enzyme release in polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Only serum-treated zymosan and heat aggregated IgG were capable of stimulating O-.2 production in normal cells and provoking lysosomal enzyme release from cytochalasin B-treated cells. This suggests that the O-.2 generating system in polymorphonuclear leukocytes is associated with the external plasma membrane of the cell, and the receptors for complement and immunoglobulins may not only serve in particle recognition but also may initiate biochemical events which accompany phagocytosis and killing."

At the end of the phagocytosis, noningested bacteria were separated and the monolayer was removed. The cells were then fractionated. The number of bacteria at different time intervals and the amount and distribution of lysosomal enzymes in the cell fractions were determined. It became apparent that the ingestion of cell-attached bacteria was independent of opsonins. However, the intracellular destruction was enhanced following opsonization with C only, although this was not the result of a greater discharge of lysosomal enzymes into the phagosome. We postulate that sublethal damage of E. coli by C renders the bacteria more sensitive to the bactericidal activity of the phagocytes.",

The levels of enhancement can be monitored by following in vitro function of cells of the lympho-reticuloendothelial system. To gain a better understanding of the physiological and biochemical nature of this enhancement, the metabolism of prostaglandin endoperoxide PGH2 was followed in mouse peritoneal cells (PCs). Homogenates of PCs from normal, unstimulated mice yielded primarily prostacyclin (PGI2) when incubated with PGH2. Homogenates of PCs from mice injected with the immunomodulators C. parvum, levamisole HCl, pyran copolymer, or thioglycollate yielded less PGI2. Reductions ranged from 73% for C. parvum to 32% for levamisole. A statistically significant inverse correlation existed between the level of macrophage \"activation\" and ability of cellular homogenates to produce prostacyclin. The results suggest that prostacyclin may be involved in modulation of nonspecific resistance.",

Contact with this surface, as well as with plain filters and polystyrene petri dishes, induced neutrophils to elaborate superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide and to generate chemiluminescence, which has been attributed to singlet oxygen. Pretreatment of the cells with cytochalasin B decreased these activities but increased release of lysosomal beta-glucuronidase, suggesting that degranulation and the burst of oxygen metabolism that characterizes phagocytes are independently regulated functions. Toxic oxygen metabolites released from neutrophils are highly reactive and could mediate tissue injury at sites of inflammation.",

Before the appearance of septicemia, the number of organisms in the lungs decreased to about 1% of the inoculation dose, and the majority could be recovered by lavage of the lungs through the trachea. In contrast, most of the organisms remained in the lavaged lungs of bacteremic mice after intranasal or intravenous inoculation. Lung surfactant obtained from infected mice was altered by a reduction in lipid and by an increase in protein.

Numbers of viable yeasts at the site were estimated at weekly intervals for 5 weeks on the basis of cultures of minced tissue excised from sacrificed animals. Organisms multiplied at the site for at least 4 weeks and were still detectable after the 5th week, although in reduced numbers. Agglutinins appeared within a week, but these antibodies were not detectable during the 2nd through the 5th week. Cryptococcal polysaccharide began to appear in the sera at 3 weeks, persisting through the duration of 5 weeks. All animals appeared healthy, but a few sickened after many months and died of systemic cryptococcosis. All of these events were observed in many separate experiments. The immunizing capacity of a cutaneous lesion was tested by challenging some of the above animals with viable C. neoformans after various intervals of time, either subcutaneously at a site distant from that of the vaccination or intravenously. Although we were unable to demonstrate reduced multiplication of yeasts in the brains, lungs, and spleens of intravenously challenged animals, it was possible to show that multiplication was inhibited at the site of subcutaneous challenge. It was noted also that vaccinated animals lived longer after lethal intravenous challenge than did nonvaccinated animals. The latter protection was observed, however, only when challenge followed vaccination by 3 weeks or longer, and it was effective only against a relatively low challenge dose. Mice were protected against a higher dose if they had previously received killed cryptococci, alternating subcutaneous and intraperitoneal inoculations, one of which contained a microbial adjuvant. No protection was observed in animals that were subcutaneously vaccinated with inert materials such as chitin, latex spheres, or even cryptococcal cell walls themselves.",

In contrast, infections initiated in nonvaccinated mice progressed beyond 10% parasitemia and were uniformly fatal within 4 weeks. Sera collected from normal mice, nonvaccinated mice infected with P. berghei, or vaccinated mice before challenge failed to passively protect recipients against virulent infection. On the other hand, sera collected from vaccinated mice after recovery from a challenge infection conferred upon passively immunized recipients protection from homologous virulent challenge, which was manifest as a delay in the onset of overt infection.

It could be shown that until day 10 after birth, young mice succumbed to an infection with even minimal doses of bacteria. Between day 15 and 30, the resistance against infection gradually increases until the rather constant level of grown-up animals is reached (Fig. 1). Juvenile mice that survive the primary infection are able to build up a state of immunity, which is rather similar to that of grown-up mice (Fig 3). Immunity against L. monocytogenes is mainly expressed by a functionally active T-cell system; the maturity of these cells in 15 days old mice could be demonstrated by the transfer of cells to \"nude\"-mice, which lack a thymus (Fig. 4). A significant increase of the non-specific resistance can be achieved even in 10 days old mice by the injection of adjuvants like pertussis organisms or endotoxin of Salmonella typhi some days before infection (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Our findings suggest that a deficiency of functionally active macrophages is responsible for the insufficient resistance against infection with L. monocytogenes in young mice.",

Whereas serum from mice which had recovered from a single infection was ineffective in transferring immunity, hyperimmune serum (from mice repeatedly challenged with P. yoelii) protected against challenge inocula of 10(4) and 5 X 10(4) but was ineffective against higher inocula (10(5)). Doses of serum which completely protected intact mice were ineffective when administered to T-cell deprived recipients.

This study, when compared to the literature, indicates that besides nephropathy specific to myelofibrosis and attributed to myeloid metaplasia in the kidney, serious consideration must be given to lesions due to (1) compression of the left kidney by the enlarged spleen, (2) urate precipitation in the urinary passages, and (3) a possible glomerular disorder whose mechanism remains undefined.",
    "output": "In the context provided, 53% of the patients with myelofibrosis showed some anomaly related to renal impairment. This includes proteinuria, issues with kidney function, cases of poorly functioning left kidney, acute anuric renal failure connected with hyperuricemia, hypokalemic tubulo-interstitial nephritis, and glomerulonephritis with nephrotic syndrome."

    "input": "Five patients who presented with acute renal failure in association with urinary tract infection are reported. Renal function improved rapidly on antibacterial therapy and no alternative cause for acute renal failure could be identified. None had previously been known to have renal disease but three of the five had taken considerable amounts of analgesics. The unusual severity of renal functional impairment resulting from urinary tract infection in these patients is unexplained but may relate to previous analgesic abuse and/or delay in treatment. Since acute non-obstructive pyelonephritis may result in severe reversible renal failure, this diagnosis must be considered in patients presenting with acute uraemia.",

    "input": "The authors report 45 cases of unilateral renal atrophy. The circumstances of discovery are related to the urological symptoms: pain, hematuria, pyuria. On the other hand, hypertension is rarely the reason for consultation. Women are more affected than men. Intravenous urography, retrograde cystography and arteriography are essential examinations to collect information concerning the etiology. Dynamic scintiscanning with measurement of the percentage of isotope fixed on the kidneys, has the advantage of permitting comparative evaluation of renal function on each side. In our study, obstruction of the urinary tract was more frequent than parenchymatous disease favoured by infection. Vascular abnormalities were rare. The etiological enquiry remained, however, negative in one third of cases. Surgical operation was necessary when a urological abnormality was the cause of persistence of severe symptoms. On the other hand, removal of the atrophic kidney does not seem to us advisable when decided simply to relieve hypertension. The latter point is particularly discussed.",

    "instruction": "What was the creatinine clearance value below which nearly all patients had a pronounced acidosis?",
    "input": "The renal acidosis may appear by a decrease of the number of nephrons able to function (decrease of the filtrate of the glomerulum) as well as by a selective alteration of the tubular acidification mechanism. In 66 patients with chronic renal insufficiency of different degrees of severity (32 patients with diabetic glomerulosclerosis, 18 patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and 16 patients with chronic pyelonephritis) studies of the parameters of the acid-base-state and the renal insufficiency were carried out. 53 of these patients had a pathologically changed acid-base-state which was most expressed in patients with chronic pyelonephritis. A characteristic relation between the renal function (creatinine clearance) and the change of the pH-values was observed. The regression curve of the pH-values was descending so that in clearance values below 25 ml/min in nearly all patients a pronounced acidosis was present. This could be proved in the patients with pyelonephritis already when higher clearance values were present. The forms of the development of the metabolic acidosis in chronic renal insufficiency are discussed.",

    "input": "The clinical manifestations of drug-induced renal disease may include all the manifestations attributed to natural or spontaneous renal diseases such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, acute nephritic syndrome, renal colic, haematuria, selective tubular defects, obstructive nephropathy, etc. It is therefore vital in any patient with renal disease whatever the clinical manifestations might be, to obtain a meticulous drug and toxin inventory. Withdrawal of the offending drug may result in amelioration or cure of the renal disorder although in the case of severe renal failure it may be necessary to utilise haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis to tide the patient over the period of acute renal failure. Analgesic nephropathy is an important cause of terminal chronic renal failure and it is therefore vital to make the diagnosis as early as possible. The pathogenesis of some drug-induced renal disorders appears to be immunologically mediated. There are many other pathogenetic mechanisms involved in drug-induced renal disorders and some drugs may under appropriate circumstances be responsible for a variety of different nephrotoxic effects. For example, the sulphonamides have been incriminated in examples of crystalluria, acute interstitial nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, generalised hypersensitivity reactions, polyarteritis nodosa and drug-induced lupus erythematosus.",

In the initial stage of the renal insufficiency the authors observed neurasthenic, radicular, polyneuritic, renovisceral syndromes, in a more remote stage--encephalopathies and disturbances of the brain circulation. The important part in the above-mentioned disturbances is played by azotemia, metabolic acidosis, disturbances of fluid-electrolyte and albumine balance, as well as arterial hypertension.",
    "output": "In the initial stage of renal insufficiency, the examined patients were observed to have neurasthenic, radicular, and polyneuritic syndromes, as well as renovisceral syndromes. These conditions are related to the nervous system and may include symptoms such as fatigue, numbness, and pain. In a more remote stage, encephalopathies and disturbances of the brain circulation were observed. These conditions are related to the brain and may include symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and stroke.

    "input": "Intraparenchymal renal aneurysms have been reported with increasing frequency; yet, to our knowledge, this subject has not been reviewed in radiologic literature. The spectrum of such aneurysms includes congenital aneurysms, those secondary to disease usually affecting the main renal arteries, those associated with renal masses, microaneurysms, and false or pseudo aneurysms. Seemingly unrelated conditions, such as atherosclerosis, bacterial endocarditis, and trauma, can all produce similar radiographic appearance of aneurysmal dilatation within the kidney, albeit through differing mechanisms. In addition, there are several etiologies for renal microaneurysms, even though this finding has been considered specific for polyarteritis in the past. Although there were a few guidelines for recognizing certain specific etiologies based solely on the angiographic appearance, it must be appreciated that many of these conditions may be indistinguishable. The possibility of hemorrhage from such intrarenal aneurysms, and the question of whether such lesions are responsible for renovascular hypertension are also discussed.",
    "output": "Conditions that can produce a similar radiographic appearance of aneurysmal dilatation within the kidney include congenital aneurysms, aneurysms secondary to diseases affecting the main renal arteries, aneurysms associated with renal masses, microaneurysms, false or pseudo aneurysms, atherosclerosis, bacterial endocarditis, and trauma. It's important to note that while these conditions may share similar appearances, they differ in their underlying mechanisms. Additionally, renal microaneurysms can have various etiologies, although they were once considered specific to polyarteritis. However, distinguishing these conditions based solely on angiographic appearance can be challenging, as many may be indistinguishable."

    "instruction": "What type of hormonal deficiency in patients with renal failure is recommended to be treated with exogenous hormonal supplementation?",
    "input": "It is evident that chronic renal failure has far-reaching metabolic consequences because endocrine aberrations are common. Uremia may alter endocrine function through its effect on the hypothalamopituitary axis, the individual end organs, and the peripheral metabolism of various hormones. Deficiency of some hormones and excess of others coexist in patients with renal failure. Since the physiologic effects of many of these abnormalities are still not well defined, no treatment is necessary with the exception of true deficiency states such as testosterone deficiency. In the latter instance, exogenous hormonal supplementation is recommended.",

    "input": "With advances in diagnostic technology, the diagnosis of renal failure from prerenal and renal causes is being made more frequently. With better clinical understanding of etiologic causes, early prevention and diagnostic and therapeutic measures can be taken. Proper and controlled use of fluids, calories, and drugs is essential. Because of its relative ease, peritoneal dialysis is usually preferred over hemodialysis when renal failure cannot be handled more conservatively. Although the incidence of renal failure has apparently increased with the advent of neonatal intensive care, survival rates are increasing and the potential for prevention is better.",
    "output": "When renal failure cannot be managed more conservatively, Peritoneal Dialysis is usually preferred over Hemodialysis due to its relative ease. This is because, with proper and controlled use of fluids, calories, and drugs, peritoneal dialysis can be more effectively managed compared to hemodialysis. However, the choice between these two methods depends on various factors including the patient's overall health, the cause and stage of renal failure, and personal preferences. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for individualized treatment recommendations."

    "input": "1. Human embryonic lung and skin fibroblasts were allowed to incorporate 32SO42- or 35SO42- and D-[1-3H]glucosamine. After removal of the medium the monolayer was subjected to sequential extractions by using EDTA, brief trypsin digestion, extraction with dithiothreitol ofllowed by freeze--thawing and extraction with trichloroacetic acid. The heparan sulphate and galactosaminoglycan contents of the various extracts were estimated after deaminative cleavage of the former component. Heparan sulphate was the major component of the trypsin digest, whereas galactosaminoglycans were the dominant component of other fractions. 2. Galactosaminoglycans of the various fractions were subjected to chemical (periodate oxidation/alkaline elimination) and enzymic (chondroitinase-AC and -ABC, as well as testicular hyaluronidase) degradations. Galactosaminoglycans from the insoluble cell fraction and the dithiothreitol extract contained larger amounts of L-iduronic acid than did those of other fractions. 3. Pulse-chase experiments were performed with and without replating of the cells at the start of the chase period. Radioactive glycans were isolated from the various extracts during the chase period. The half-lives of glycans of the insoluble cell fraction and the dithioreitol extract were shorter (5--8h) than were those of the trypsin digest and the EDTA extract (22h and 11h respectively). After replating of the cells in chase medium, radioactive cell-associated glycans were secreted from the cells and could be recovered in the trypsin digest, the EDTA extract and the medium. Furthermore, 35S/3H ratios of glycans from all these fractions decreased during the chase period. The following conclusions were reached. The insoluble cell fraction contains the synthesis pool and some structural material, whereas the soluble cell fraction is the storage and degradation pool. The dithiothreitol extract appears to contain the immediate precursors of secreted material. The trypsin-released glycans comprise structural components as well as material destined for pinocytosis or secretion into the medium. The EDTA extract is considered to consist of glycans en route to the medium. 4. The two presumptive precursor pools were preferentially depleted of L-iduronic acid-rich galactosaminoglycans during the chase. Glycans recovered from the trypsin digest, the EDTA extract and the medium during the chase contained larger amounts of periodate-resistant uronic acid residues (D-glucuronic acid and/or L-iduronic acid O-sulphate) than did their precursors. It is proposed that polymer-level modifications of secreted glycans are partly responsible for the results.",
    "output": "The half-life of the glycans found in the trypsin digest was 22 hours, as per the context provided. This was determined through pulse-chase experiments, where the half-lives of glycans from various fractions were compared. The glycans from the insoluble cell fraction and the dithiothreitol extract had shorter half-lives (5--8 hours), while the half-life of glycans from the trypsin digest was 22 hours."

    "instruction": "What is the sole hydrolysis product yielded by the susceptibility of the glucan to a specific alpha-1,3-glucanase from Aspergillus nidulans?",
    "input": "Chemical analysis indicated that D-glucose is tha major neutral monosaccharide present in the microcysts of a range of gram-negative bacteria. Varying amounts of other neutral sugars were found. The glucose was mainly present as a glucan that could be extracted from microcysts of representative strains with alkali or mild acid treatment. The glucan could be identified as an alpha-1,3-linked polymer on the basis of (i) periodate resistance of the extracted polymer and the material present in microcysts; (ii) lectin agglutination of the microcysts; (iii) lectin precipitation of the extracted glucans; and (iv) susceptibility of the glucan either in the walls or after extraction to a specific alpha-1,3-glucanase from Aspergillus nidulans, yielding glucose as the sole hydrolysis product. The galactosamine found in microcysts of Myxococcus xanthus by other workers is clearly a component of another polymer, distinct from the glucan. The presence of an alpha 1,3-linked glucan, common to microcyst walls of various bacterial genera, probably contributes to the rigidity of the walls of these forms and, inter alia, to their resistance to ultrasonic treatment. Preliminary experiments indicate that the gulcan is discarded on germination of the microcysts rather than being broken down by specific enzymes.",

    "input": "Plasma membranes were isolated from an ascites hepatoma, AH 130, by the fluorescein mercuric acetate (FMA) method. Glycopeptides and mucopolysaccharides were prepared by digesting the membranes with pronase, then by fractionating the digest chromatographically and electrophoretically. Isolated fractions were analyzed for their amino acid and carbohydrate compositions. Results were compared with those for corresponding fractions from AH 66 (J. Biochem. 76, 319-333 (1974)). Mucopolysaccharides and a series of glycopeptides were isolated from the fraction excluded from Sephadex G-50. The mucopolysaccharides were identified as a family of heparan sulfates with different electrophoretic mobilities. The glycopeptides contained serine, threonine, galactose, galactosamine, glucosamine, and sialic acid as the major constituents as aspartic acid and mannose as minor ones. This suggests that most of the carbohydrate moieties are linked to serine or threonine (O-glycosidic), and that some are linked to asparagine (N-glycosidic). No nearly purely O-glycosidic glycopeptides were found in this fraction from AH 130, through they were the major glycopeptides from the AH 66 plasma membranes. In the fraction included in the gel, glycopeptides containing fucose, galactose, mannose, glucosamine, glaactosamine, and sialic acid were found. The presence of galactosamine suggests that some of the glycopeptides are O-glycosidic though most are N-glycosidic. In the corresponding fraction from AH 66, nearly purely N-glycosidic glycopeptides were found.",
    "output": "The method used to isolate plasma membranes from the ascites hepatoma, AH 130, was the fluorescein mercuric acetate (FMA) method. This is inferred from the context as it is the only method mentioned in the passage for isolating plasma membranes from the AH 130 hepatoma."

    "input": "Proteolytic digests of liver plasma-cell membranes from the cow were fractionated to yield two homogeneous glycopeptides and a third preparation about 92% pure. The composition of the two homogeneous glycopeptides made it clear that they were derived from basement membrane material rather than the plasma membrane. Ruminants are unusual in having large amounts of basement membrane in the liver while other animals generally have little or none. Both basement-membrane-derived glycopeptides contained a glucosyl galactosyl disaccharide linked to hydroxylysine, the smaller one contained no other sugar structure but the larger one contained in addition an acidic heterosaccharide, the two chains probably being linked separately to the same molecule. Smith degradation and beta-elimination operations show that this heterosaccharide has an inner structure containing mannose and hexosamine, with the sugars galactose, N-glycollyl-neuraminic acid and fucose situated more peripherally. The amino-acid-heterosaccharide linkage is alkali stable. The third glycopeptide, which may be plasma-membrane-derived, differs from the heterosaccharide described above in that it contains no glucose and contains some O-seryl and O-threonyl amino-acid--sugar linkage. It, too, has a periodate-resistant structure of hexosamine and mannose.",

In this way, individual acidic complex saccharides (hyaluronic acid, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate A, chondroitin sulfate C, dermatan sulfate, sulfated glycopeptide, and sialoglycopeptide) were separated into 2-5 subfractions. The specific radioactivity of hexosamine in the subfractions indicated that the metabolic rate of the uterine complex saccharides as follows: hyaluronic acid greater than sulfated glycopeptide greater than heparan sulfate greater than chondroitin sulfate C greater than dermatan sulfate. In addition, metabolic heterogeneity of heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate A, chondroitin sulfate C, and dermatan sulfate was suggested.",

Sections of each spinal segment were examined with both the DAB and the de Olmos O-dianisidine techniques. Results common to all three species were found. In Clarke's nucleus, the central cervical nucleus, and the spinal border cells there were many heavily labeled cells. Clarke's nucleus was found to project primarily ipsilaterally; the spinal border cells primarily contralaterally; and the central cervical nucleus bilaterally. In addition to these aggregates of spinocerebellar neurons there were numerous labeled neurons scattered throughout the spinal grey. Labeled neurons were found in all portions of the spinal grey except the substantia gelatinosa and lateral cervical nucleus and occurred in all spinal segments. They varied in morphology from large multipolar neurons, found predominantly in the ventral horn to small globular and fusiform neurons that were most abundant in the dorsal horn.

    "input": "Retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used to determine the origins of afferent connexions to the visual cortex (areas 17, 18a and 18b) in the hamster. The distribution of neurons projecting to the visual cortex from other cortical areas, from the thalamus and from the brainstem was studied using a computer technique for three-dimensional reconstruction. There is a topographically organized projection from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus to area 17, but probably to no other of the areas studied. The lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus (LP) projects to area 18a and weakly to area 17. The lateral nucleus (L) projects to area 18b and also, probably, weakly to area 17. The cortical projections from LP and L are also organized topographically but relatively grossly compared with the geniculo-cortical pathway. There are reciprocal association projections between area 17 and areas 18a and 18b. Areas 18a projects weakly to 18b. The main commissural connexions of the posterior neocortex are between the area 17/18a boundary zones in the two hemispheres, with little between the bodies of area 17. Labelled neurons were found bilaterally in the locus coeruleus, more ipsilaterally than contralaterally, after multiple injections into the visual cortex: single, small injections sometimes resulted in the labelling of a single cell body in the locus coeruleus.",
    "output": "The origin of the topographically organized projection to area 17 in the visual cortex is the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus. This pathway is more precise and organized compared to the projections from the lateral posterior nucleus (LP) and the lateral nucleus (L) of the thalamus, and from the cortical areas to the visual cortex. Additionally, there are bilateral connections from the locus coeruleus in the brainstem to the visual cortex."

    "input": "The medullary \"heart area\", origins of the vagal preganglionic fibers innervating the heart, were identified in 19 cats with the use of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a retrograde axonal tracer. When HRP was injected in the A-V node area, S-A node area, right atrial wall and right ventricular wall, the labeled neurons were principally found in the lateral half of the dorsal motor nucleus (DMN) and in the medial solitary nucleus (MSN), were almost the same in number bilaterally, and were chiefly from the calamus scriptorius to the upper cervical cord. They showed no anatomical proof for asymmetric distribution. When HRP was injected in the left ventricular wall or the apex, few labeled neurons were identified in the DMN. Labeled neurons were not found in the nucleus ambiguus. This study suggests the labeled neurons in the DMN and MSN are origins of the dually innervating vagal preganglionic fibers to the heart.",

Following injections of HRP in the dorsolateral pontine nucleus, where the tectopontine fibers terminate, a fair number of labeled cells are found throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the ipsilateral superior colliculus. Relatively few of the labeled cells are of medium size (25-40 micron in diameter), more than 80% are small (10-25 micron), but no large cells are labeled. The cell bodies giving rise to tectopontine fibers are distributed in tectal layers deeper than the optic stratum (including this), with only a few in the deeper portion of the superficial gray layer. There are only few labelled cells in the relatively large lateral portion of the intermediate and deep gray layers were the largest neurons (more than 40 micron) are located. Most of these presumably belong to the tectoreticular and the tectospinal projections. The tectal neurons, distributed in various collicular layers, are supposed to receive different kinds of information from other parts of the central nervous system, e.g. from the retina, the cerebral cortex, the brain stem reticular formation, the spinal cord etc. The dorsolateral pontine nucleus appears to have a particular function in the integration of the input from the superior colliculus with those from other sources, especially from the inferior colliculus and the auditory cerebral cortex.",

To find the ascending side of the axons, injections were made following hemisections at C1 or between C1 and C2. Labeled spinocerebellar tract neurons were classified into two groups according to the axonal course in the spinal cord; one is composed of neurons with uncrossed ascending axons and the other, neurons with crossed ascending axons. Neurons of origin of the uncrossed tracts were located in the medial part of lamina VI of C2 to C8, the central part of lamina VII of C4 to C8, lamina V of C7 to L3 and Clarke's column. Neurons of origin of the crossed tracts were found in the central cervical nucleus of C1 to C3, the intermediate zone and the ventral horn of the lower thoracic and the lumbar segments (T11 to L3), and in the dorsal horn, the medial part of lamina VII and the ventrolateral part of the ventral horn of the sacral and caudal spinal cord.

Two to 3 days after injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the cortex, the animals were anesthetized, and the brains fixed and processed for the histochemical demonstration of the enzyme marker. Labeled neurons were found in layer III in the ipsilateral prefrontal, parietal, occipital and temporal cortices, notably in areas 5, 19, 22 and 46 of Brodmann, and in area 7 of the contralateral parietal cortex. In the thalamus, HRP-positive cells were located ipsilaterally in the medial pulvinar nucleus in the nuclei centrum medianum and parafascicularis, as well as in the rostral thalamus, lateral and medial to the mammillothalamic tract, in the nucleus ventralis anterior and nucleus paracentralis. Numerous labeled cells were also identified in the magnocellular nuclei of the basal forebrain, in the dorsal and medial raphe nuclei, and in the locus coeruleus. Most of the cells in these regions were located in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the injections, but a number of them were also found in the contralateral hemispher. In adult monkeys, brownish granules in the cytoplasm of some cells were interpreted as endogenous pigment or due to various pigment precursors. However, all 14 locations listed above were identified in the infant monkey in which endogenous pigment was not a confounding factor.",

In all the cases HRP was transported retrogradely to the brain stem neurons in the medial reticular formation, vestibular complex and the red nucleus. The present findings demonstrate that, in addition to the above mentioned groups, there exist several other groups of neurons. Many labelled neurons are present in the locus coeruleus and the nucleus subcoeruleus, ipsilaterally. These neurons seem to be located in the same position as the monoaminergic (catecholamine-containing) neurons. Labelled HPR-positive neurons are present in the retroambiguous nucleus and in the upper pontine tegmentum adjoining the rubrospinal tract, mainly contralaterally, in the bulbar raphe, the mesencephalic central gray and the hypothalamus, mainly ipsilaterally. The occurrence of retrograde-labelled neurons in the locus coeruleus and the dorsal hypothalamus after HRP injections as far caudally as the lumbar segments, indicates that these cell groups give rise to descending fibres which pass almost the entire length of the spinal cord.",

There were no statistically significant deviations from expected antigen distribution in patients with any of the various forms of leprosy, though the number of patients studied is relatively small. There were some interesting trends, particularly a possible decrease in the number of tuberculoid patients with A9, and an increase in the proportions of lepromatous patients with B18 and B40. Limited evidence of a genetically controlled pre-disposition to the clinical manifestations of leprosy suggests that further studies with extended typing should be carried out on the HLA haplotype segregation in informative leprosy families. These should provide a clearer indication of the relevance of the HLA (including DR) and possibly of other non-HLA loci to the possible mechanism(s) of disease susceptibility.",

Nineteen pa;ients with widespread visceral involvement and more rapidly progressive disease had an increased frequency of HLA-B8 (relative risk = 4.14; P less than 0.05) when compared to thirty-three less severely affected patients and 3000 controls. Patients with severe and progressive disease also had defective cell-mediated immunity with reductions in both the numbers of circulating thymus-dependent (T) lymphocytes and in the lymphocyte transformation response to phytohaemagglutinin. These findings suggest that a genetic factor, such as an abnormal immune response gene, may be involved in the progression of the disease.",
    "output": "The relative risk of HLA-B8 in patients with widespread visceral involvement and more rapidly progressive systemic sclerosis (SS) was 4.14 times higher than in less severely affected patients and controls. This suggests that the HLA-B8 allele may be associated with a more aggressive form of the disease. Additionally, these patients also showed signs of defective cell-mediated immunity, with reduced numbers of circulating T lymphocytes and a reduced lymphocyte transformation response to phytohaemagglutinin. These findings support the idea that a genetic factor, such as an abnormal immune response gene, may play a role in the progression of SS."

HLA typing was done by lymphocyte microcytotoxicity tests for nine antigens on sublocus A and 15 antigens on sublocus B. HLA-B7 and HLA-B12 were decreased in CML patients compared to both platelet and granulocyte donors. There was increased frequency of HLA-A3 in patients (41%) as compared to controls (25% and 33%); HLA-B5 - patients = 20%; controls 8% and 6%; and HLA-BW17 - patients = 17%; controls = 6% and 3% (P = 0.01).

In one family, an HLA-A1 -B8 haplotype seems to be linked to the manifestation of atopic disease. The pattern of association of an HLA-A9 -B7 haplotype with the disease process in another family indicates that multiple genes may be involved in the manifestation of a variety of allergic disorders. Although more than one HLA haplotype of HLA-associated Ir gene for one antigen have been postulated, we still do not have enough evidence to suggest linkage between HLA haplotypes and atopic allergy. Further studies utilizing mixed lymphocyte culture and carefully matched control with a large number of subjects and more families are in progress to study the genetic basis of allergic diseases.",

We have investigated HLA-A, B, C and D/DR antigens in the family members. This gave us the opportunity to evaluate the validity of different assays for the determination of HLA-D alleles in a family material where the MLC tests formed the basis for a correct assignment of HLA-D determinants.

This could be an expression of \"long\" and \"short\" HLA-D antigens or be due to differences in weak antigens outside the HLA-D region. Two further healthy HLA-B7 homozygous subjects were studied; one was apparently heterozygous for DW 2, the other apparently carried no DW 2 antigen. Both could discriminate between different DW 2 homozygous test cells. Two such test cells--one from a patient with multiple sclerosis (MS) and the other from a man with two children with MS--gave variable and absurb reactions with cells from the two subjects in question. It is tentatively suggested that genes exist which, when present in both moities in a mixed leucocyte reaction (MLR), can impair the MLR and give false \"typing\" reactions. This might be more common among patients with MS and perhaps also some other diseases (certain arthritides, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) than among healthy subjects and can complicate or make impossible the interpretation of HLA-D typing data. It could also explain the previously-described impaired MLR between cells from patients with these diseases.",

They can promote secretion of a hormone, alter its rate of removal from plasma, change plasma protein-binding characteristics, or modify routes of metabolism. Estrogens have a preparative effect on the uterine endometrium. There are biologic, clinical and epidemiologic reasons for believing that estrogen administration to postmenopausal women increases the risk for endometrial cancer. Although there are similar biologic reasons to associate prolonged estrogenic stimulation with breast cancerr, evidence for such an association is weak. Oral contraceptive use has been associated with a variety of hepatocellular tumors. Although estrogens, per se, can effect several hepatic functions, it seems likely that the 17 alpha-alkyl and 17 alpha-ethinyl functions of the progestins and estrogens are involved in this process. The role of estrogen use during pregnancy in the causation of vaginal cancer in female offspring and the role of androgens in prostate cancer have been discussed.",

    "input": "Gonadal function in both sexes is under the synergistic control of the pituitary gonadotrophins, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) which are in turn influenced both by the hypothalamus (via the gonadotrophin releasing hormone) and by feedback signals from the gonads. There is good evidence that such feedback is mediated by steroid hormones and by a product of the germinal epithelium, termed inhibin. A logical approach to reproductive disorders involves the localization of the primary disturbance either to the hypothalamo-pituitary unit or to the gonad, on the basis of history, physical findings and the results of hormone assays. In men, the majority of disorders leading to infertility are of unknown aetiology and cannot, therefore, be treated specifically. In women, anovulation is usually readily treatable and recent studies have emphasised the usefulness of prolactin assays and of specific treatment for hyperprolactinaemia in restoring ferility. Increased understanding of the mechanisms leading to infertility may provide valuable new approaches to fertility control.",

    "instruction": "What is the name of the experimental ergot derivative that is a potent suppressor of prolactin secretion from the anterior pituitary?",
    "input": "Lactation is controlled by hormones from several endocrine glands. An undisturbed function of the anterior pituitary, of the adrenals, and of the ovaries is a prerequisite for a normal morphogenesis of the mammary gland. The epithelial ducts proliferative under the combined influence of estrogens, glucocorticoids and growth hormone, whereas the lobuloalveolar development depends on progesterone and prolactin in addition to the fore-mentioned hormones. During pregnancy pituitary prolactin may be substituted by placental lactogen. Milk synthesis begins in the second half of pregnancy. It is supported by prolactin and cortisol, which directly act on enzyme activities and processes of differentiation of the alveolar cells. The sudden surge in the secretion of milk after parturition is most likely due to the rapid decline of the serum levels of progesterone. The ejection of milk from the lactating mammary gland is controlled by a neuroendocrine reflex mechanism. Suckling is the appropriate stimulus for the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. Oxytocin increases intramammary pressure by inducing contraction of the myoepithelial cells and thus aids in expelling the milk from the mammary glands. Maintenance of normal postpartum lactation depends on frequent and intensive suckling. Suckling does not only stimulate the release of oxytocin, but also provokes secretion of prolactin and ACTH. This increase in prolactin caused by suckling guarantees galactopoesis. Influencing secretion of prolactin has been proven to be a useful tool for regulating lactation. The experimental ergot derivative 2-Brom-alpha-ergocryptine is a potent suppressor of prolactin secretion from the anterior pituitary. In contrast to estrogens, alone or in combination with progestagens or androgens, this drug is not only effective in suppressing the onset of lactation, but also in inhibiting lactation once milk secretion had started. As to stimulating lactation in the human there is no effective drug available up to now.",

    "input": "The endocrine role in lactation is undisputed, but attempts to correlate milk production with various endocrine products have had limited success. Recent work has suggested that placental hormones, in particular placental lactogen, may be an important regulator of lactation capacity. In addition to concentrations of hormones in blood, it is important to consider receptors in target tissue for the hormones. The concentration of receptors in a tissue may vary with genotype of the individual or under the influence of hormonal state. Other aspects of the target tissue's system for response also must be considered.",

This hormone, produced by the placenta, could play a crucial role in milk production. However, it's important to note that the regulation of lactation involves not just the concentration of hormones in the blood, but also the presence and activity of receptors in target tissues, which can vary based on individual genetics or hormonal state.

The obtained results can be summarized as follows: 1) existence of putative receptors for various hormones (estradiol, testosterone, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, progesterone, prolactin) in the mammalian pineal gland; (2) steroid metabolic pattern in the pineal gland resembling other brain areas involved in gonadotrophic regulation; (3) control of pineal estrophilic and androphilic receptors by adrenergic transmitter through beta-adrenergic receptors and at a translational level; (4) denervation supersensitivity of hormone receptors to neurotransmitter; (5) modification of neuronal activity by hormone treatment at ganglionic and preganglionic sites of action; (6) estrophilic binding sites in ganglia; (7) correlation of pineal responsiveness to hormones with activity of sympathetic nerves; (8) modification by hormones of pineal beta-adrenergic mechanisms; (9) dissociation of hormone effects on the pineal gland in those mediated or modulated by changes in afferent neuronal activity and those relatively unaffected by denervation. Collectively these data indicate that neuroendocrine, endocrine-neural and endocrine-endocrine transducing processes occur in the pinealocytes and superior cervical ganglia.",

    "instruction": "What happens to the concentrations of progesterone and estrogen in plasma at the time when mammary cells start secreting normal milk after calving?",
    "input": "Estrogen stimulates development of mammary ducts, and progesterone and estrogen stimulate proliferation of secretory tissues. In vivo, sequential addition of insulin (step 1), glucocorticoid (step 2), and prolcatin (step 3) leads to biosynthesis of casein and lactose. In cows, mammogenesis continues until termination of pregnancy and overlaps onset of lactation. Progesterone probably inhibits differentiation of secretory cells at step 2 or step 3. Sensitivity of individual cells to progestational inhibition may decrease variably which may be interdependent upon relative increases in estrogen, prolactin, corticoids, and growth hormone to cause asynchronies among them at calving. Since prolactin in plasma is not correlated with progesterone or the estrogens, factors other than feed-back effects of ovarian steroids may be responsible for its sustained increase periparturiently. Also, elevated prolactin periparturiently may be unrelated to subsequent rates of lactation because its \"basal\" concentrations may meet requirements when inhibiting effects of progesterone are removed. This concept is attractive because mammary cells neither are synchronized highly for biosynthesis nor secrete normal milk for several days after calving. At the latter time, concentrations in plasma are low for progesterone and estrogen, similar to 3 days before calving for glucocoiticoids and prolactin, and increasing for insulin. Evidence of lactation under unusual circumstances was discussed.",
    "output": "At the time when mammary cells start secreting normal milk after calving, the concentrations of progesterone and estrogen in plasma decrease. This decrease allows for the uninhibited action of prolactin, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of casein and lactose in the mammary cells. The decrease in progesterone and estrogen concentrations occurs as the inhibitory effects of these hormones are removed, allowing for the mammary cells to synchronize and secrete normal milk. This process takes several days after calving, and the concentrations of progesterone and estrogen in plasma are similar to 3 days before calving for glucocorticoids and prolactin at this time, while insulin concentrations are increasing."

    "instruction": "What percentage of patients with hyperprolactinaemia report galactorrhoea?",
    "input": "Prolactin exists in man as a distinct and separate anterior pituitary hormone from growth hormone. It is important in lactation and the control of gonadal function, although it may have a much wider and basic metabolic role, similar to its role in lower forms. In clinical endocrinology it is important as an index of pituitary and hypothalamic diseases; thus prolactin levels are elevated in association with these conditions and this reflects the normal tonic inhibitory hypothalamic control of prolactin by PIF; DA is the most important PIF. Hyperprolactinaemia causes hypogonadism in both men and women; it may present in women with amenorrhoea, oligomenorrhoea, polymenorrhoea, regular cycles with anovulation or a defective luteal phase, and impotence in men. In either sex galactorrhoea is reported to occur in only 30 per cent of patients. Neurotransmitter therapy, with dopamine agonists which act as functional analogues of PIF, restores prolactin levels to normal and leads to a return of normal gonadal function. The mechanism of the hypogonadism is not clear and is discussed together with the problems associated with inducing pregnancy in these patients, who may harbour microadenomata of the pituitary.",

    "input": "The plasma concentration of ACTH (by radioimmunoassay) was measured in 56 healthy parturients and their newborns. Umbilical cord and maternal venous blood were collected immediately after delivery. In addition one venous blood sample was taken from 50 newborns at the age of 15, 30, 60 min, 2, 6, 12, or 24 h. The maternal and cord plasma ACTH levels were higher than the levels in healthy nonpregnant women. There are no differences between the mean maternal (226 +/- 146 pg/ml) and cord (226 +/- 147 pg/ml) values of ACTH. The high ACTH levels of cord plasma remain unchanged for 30 min, decrease significantly during the 1-6 h after birth, because of the elimination process of the circulated foetal ACTH, and increase over the next 12-24 h and slightly thereafter indicating an initiation of neonatal pituitary ACTH secretion. The plasma ACTH level in the mothers with membranes ruptured for 1-5 h was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher compared with that in the mothers with membranes ruptured for less than 1 h. However, the duration of ruptured membranes appeared to have no effect on the cord blood ACTH level.",

The labor was monitored by cardiotocography; the new born infants were examined by the pediatrician. Following oral indomethacin treatment (25 mg every 6 Hours for 5 days) no untoward effects was observed on maternal and fetal wellbeing during pregnancy and labor. Four out 29 newborn infants, all appropriate for gestational age of 36--40 weeks, had one-minute Apgar scores less than 7, cyanosis, tachypnea, hypoxemia and serious oxygen dependency for several days. All the infant survived. These abnormalities may be due to short-term exposure to indomethacin and consequent inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase, impairement of prostaglandin-dependent physiological regulation of vessel tone during fetal life and circulatory disorders at birth.",

Blood pH and partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide also were measured in samples collected from the jugular vein of the cow and the caudal aorta and vena cava of the fetus. Concentration of chloride in fetal plasma was generally lower than the corresponding maternal value, and fetal potassium was greater than maternal. Potassium of fetal plasma increased towards term. Sodium concentrations were not significantly different between fetal and maternal plasms.

Fourteen to 20 per cent of maternal blood was estimated to have been removed within 30 minutes, which resulted in a drop of 30 per cent of mean maternal arterial pressure. A fetal bradycardia started 28 +/- 13 minutes after the beginning of maternal hemorrhage. It lasted 30 +/- 15 minutes and was concomitant with a rise in fetal arterial pressure. It was followed by a long-lasting fetal tachycardia of 130 +/- 38 minutes and was corrected only by reinfusion of blood to the mother. The fetal blood gases demonstrated a mild asphyxia with a persistent metabolic acidemia until reinfusion of blood to the mother. Maternal and fetal plasma cortisol levels rose significantly at the end of the hemorrhage. Tracheal fluid flow did not change. Fetal breathing recorded 20 hours before and 24 hours after the experiment did not show consistent changes, but during fetal bradycardia there was no fetal breathing.

There is a slight rise in the levels of immunoglobulins A in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The overall rise in the blood levels of transferrin under the effect of oestrogens is confirmed. Norms were obtained for the levels of the IgA/T ratio which drops progressively as pregnancy progresses and with oral contraception. It has been found that in the last two trimesters the upper limit of the normal is 1 for the IgA/T ratio as compared with 1.9 in the general population.

A sequential combination of hPL measurements and intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring (FHRM) (performed in 61 patients) gave a high degree of prognosis (75% of abnormalities detected, 88% with normal tests having no abnormalities). Considered separately, neither maternal serum hPL levels nor FHRM predicted abnormalities in the offspring to the same high degree. On the other hand, hPL could not be correlated with staining, desquamation, and the presence of meconium in the amniotic fluid at delivery, these criteria being considered separately or in combination. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels during late gestation showed considerable variation and did not permit distinction between pregnancies with or without an abnormality in the offspring.",

Rous-associated virus-60-type recombinant viruses isolated after infection of chicken cells with strains tsLA337PR-B or tsNY21SR-A, both of which produce a temperature-sensitive DNA polymerase, also possessed the temperature-sensitive lesion. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the endogenous viral information used for the generation of Rous-associated virus-60 is deficient in at least part of the pol gene and that the defect includes that portion represented by the lesions in NY21 and LA337. The frequency of polymerase-negative BH-Rous sarcoma virus alpha formation was not affected by the levels of endogenous viral expression, which suggests that the alpha defect is not derived from the endogenous pol gene.",

Production of infectious RSV following these injections depended upon the viral envelope-messenger activity of the injected RNA. This system constituted a sensitive and rigorous assay system for viral envelope-messenger RNA. It was found that 21S mRNA from RAV-2-infected cells expressed the highest activity, while 35S mRNA expressed comparatively little. In addition, RAV-2-virion RNA expressed little messenger activity. The rate of formation of infectious RSV following 21S mRNA injections reached a peak near 9 hr, which was followed by a rapid decline.

In contrast to Rous sarcoma virus-infected permissive avian cells, only two of three discrete species of virus-specific RNA were detected in the cytoplasm of these vole cells. These included genome-length 35S RNA and a 21S RNA. However, viral 28S RNA, routinely detected in the cytoplasm of productively infected avian cells, could not be found in cytoplasmic RNA from vole cells. In addition, a low-molecular-weight viral RNA sedimenting less than 16S was detected in both infected avian and vole cells. Because of its heterogeneity this latter species is most likely generated from the intracellular degradation of the larger viral RNAs. Both the viral 35S and 21S RNA were also found to be associated with total polyribosomes from these vole cells. Studies were also performed to determine the distribution of both total viral genomic and sarcoma-specific RNA sequences among the size classes of fractionated total polyribosomes. In both vole cell types the majority of cytoplasmic viral RNA sequences were also associated with polyribosomes and were similarly distributed among the size classes of total polyribosomes.

The specificities, genetic complexities, and map locations of the selected cDNA's were shown to be in good agreement with the size and map locations of the corresponding viral genes. Analyses of virus-specific RNA, using the specific cDNA's as molecular probes, demonstrated that oncovirus-infected cells contained genome-length (30-40S) RNA plus either one or two species of subgenome-length viral RNA. The size and genetic content of these RNAs varied, depending on the genetic makeup of the infecting virus, but in each case the smaller RNAs contained only sequences located near the 3' end of the viral genome. Three RNA species were detected in Schmidt-Ruppin Rous sarcoma virus-infected cells: 39S (genome-length) RNA; 28S RNA, with an apparent sequence of env-src-c-poly(A); and 21S RNA, with an apparent sequence of src-c-poly(A). Cells infected with the Bryan high-titer strain of Rous sarcoma virus, which lacks the env gene, contained genome-length (35S) RNA and 21S src-specific RNA, but not the 28S RNA species. Leukosis virus-infected cells contained two detectable RNA species: 35S (genome-length) RNA and 21S RNA, with apparent sequence env-c-poly(A). Since gag and pol sequences were detected only in genome-length RNAs, it seems likely that the full-length transcripts function as mRNA for these two genes. The 28S and 21S RNAs could be the active messengers for the env and src genes.

PV also serves as a helper for the glycoprotein-defective Rous sarcoma virus. However, PV was shown to be different from both ALSV and reticuloendotheliosis virus in the following properties: (i) PV does not have ALSV group specific antigens; (ii) the protein composition of PV is different from those of the other two groups of viruses; (iii) PV fails to complement the defective polymerase of alpha type Rous sarcoma virus; and (iv) PV RNA shows no detectable homology with nucleic acids of the other two groups of viruses.

These particles were found more consistently in Rous sarcoma virus-infected than Rous-associated virus-infected cultures, but were generally present in only a small fraction of the total infected cells. The results of the survey of cells infected with various strains of leukosis-sarcoma viruses led to the hypothesis that the A particles develop in cells undergoing cytopathological degeneration. The hypothesis explains also the evanescent nature of the appearance of these particles in infected cells. The application of immunoelectron microscopic methods using monospecific antisera against viral internal proteins revealed that the A particles contain components immunologically related to the proteins of C-type virus.",

    "input": "Nonproducer and producer RSV-transformed cells and producer nontransforming virus-infected cells harbor viral DNA specifying the respective avian tumor virus. In nonproducer Rous sarcoma cells, the residing viral DNA is linear, double-stranded and covalently linked to the chromosomal DNA. Both double-stranded and single-stranded forms of RSV DNA transfect chicken cells. The progeny virus is indistinguishable from the DNA parent with respect to the morphological, biological and antigenic properties. Unlike the DNA extracted from nonproducer RSV-transformed mammalian cells, that extracted from producer RSV-transformed chicken cells gives rise, in transfection experiments, to both sarcoma virus and its nontransforming derivative. The DNA from nontransforming virus-infected chicken cells generates only nontransforming viruses. The frequency of nontransforming virus recovery is different from that of sarcoma virus recovery, the latter being a nonlinear function of the amount of transfecting DNA, while the former may suggest a linear relationship. On the other hand, the end-point dilution of transfecting DNA for sarcoma virus recovery is approximately the same as that for nontransforming virus recovery. The following is assumed: Sarcoma viruses and nontransforming derivatives are recovered from two different species of viral DNA which carry or lack, respectively, the transforming genetic material. The size of double-stranded viral DNA is substantially smaller than 20 times 10(6) daltons. In transfection experiments, the sarcoma virus DNA is first integrated into the host cell genome before being expressed, while the nontransforming viral DNA apparently bypasses the integration step. The latter DNA generates the progeny virus when taken up, carried, and transcribed in a permissive cell.",
    "output": "The relationship between the amount of transfecting DNA and the frequency of recovery of sarcoma virus in transfection experiments is nonlinear. This means that an increase in the amount of transfecting DNA does not necessarily result in a proportional increase in the frequency of sarcoma virus recovery. On the other hand, the frequency of nontransforming virus recovery may suggest a linear relationship, but the end-point dilution for both sarcoma and nontransforming virus recovery is approximately the same. This suggests that while the relationship between the amount of transfecting DNA and the frequency of sarcoma virus recovery is not straightforward, the efficiency of the transfection process itself remains constant."

    "instruction": "What percentage of the genetic information carried by each subunit of viral RNA is coding for cell transformation?",
    "input": "The oncornaviruses share several biological, biochemical, and structural properties that distinguish them from other RNA viruses. Rous sarcoma virus, a representative of avian oncornaviruses, manifests two major functions: cell transformation and virus replication. Both functions are independent, and are expressed separately in defective viruses. The virus has a 60-70S RNA, composed of 35 S subunits. It appears that each subunit of viral RNA carries the same genetic information and, furthermore, that 10% of this information is coding for cell transformation. Without this 10% the virus can still replicate. The RNA genome is expressed when the virus penetrates a sensitive cell, provided the virus carries an active reverse transcriptase. Virus-transformed cells possess a DNA form of the viral genome. The viral DNA is infectious, and can lead, upon transfection of permissive cells, to the production of a new viral progeny. We have established that the minimum molecular weight of the viral DNA is 6 X 10(6) daltons, and that this DNA is covalently bound to the chromosomal DNA. Also by examining the frequency of transfection events in the DNA-treated cells we suggest that transfection is a single-hit phenomenon. It follows that viral DNA of 6 X 10(6) daltons carries all the genetic information to code for the virus production. It seems likely that the transfection mechanism giving rise to transforming viruses is different from that producing nontransforming segments. In general terms, the experimental data indicate that certain RNAs and DNAs could accomplish malignant transformation if they are able to penetrate into the cell and give rise to the DNA forms which could be integrated into the cellular genome.",

    "instruction": "What was the approximate amount of ID50 units of sarcoma virus per microgram of DNA from cells infected with sarcoma virus alone?",
    "input": "Cellular DNA of 50--54 S was extracted from chicken embryo cells doubly infected with two different avian sarcoma viruses and was analyzed by the infectious DNA assay. Approximately 80--90% of the transformed foci that were induced by this DNA were found to give rise to one kind of avian sarcoma virus only, indicating that most proviral genomes are not integrated in tandem. When the two infecting viruses were varied with respect to multiplicity or time of infection, the initial infecting virus or the virus of higher multiplicity of infection was recovered at higher frequency in foci produced by the extracted DNA. This observation suggests that existence of common integration sites for different avian sarcoma viruses. Cells uniformly infected with avian leukosis virus could be transformed by superinfection with an avian sarcoma virus from a different envelope subgroup. Infectious DNA recovered from such cells contained 3--10 50% infectious dose (ID50) units of leukosis virus per microgram but only 0.3--0.4 ID50 of sarcoma virus. DNA from cells infected with sarcoma virus alone contained 3 sarcoma virus ID50 per microgram. These results suggest that, even though a second virus integrates with lower efficiency into preinfected cells, there is not a complete block of integration sites by the first virus.",

    "instruction": "What percentage of hybridization with cDNAsrc was observed in the RNAs of the td mutants used in this study?",
    "input": "We previously reported the isolation of a newly recovered avian sarcoma virus (rASV) from tumors of chickens injected with transformation-defective (td) mutants of the Schmidt-Ruppin strain of Rous sarcoma virus (SR-RSV). In this paper, we present further biological and biochemical characterization of the recovered sarcoma viruses. High titers of rASV's were generally obtained by cocultivation of tumor cells with normal chicken embryo fibroblasts or by homogenization of tumor tissues. Most rASV isolates were similar to SR-RSV, subgroup A (SR-RSV-A), in their growth characteristics and were nondefective in replication. The subgroup specificity of rASV's and the electrophoretic mobilities of their structural proteins were the same as those parental td viruses. The nondefectiveness of rASV's was further substantiated by the size of their genomic RNA, which was indistinguishable from that of SR-RSV-A and substantially larger than that of parental td RNA. Molecular hybridization using complementary DNA specific to the src gene of SR-RSV (cDNAsrc) showed that the RNAs of td mutants used in this study contained extensive deletions within the src gene (7 to 30% hybridization with cDNAsrc); the same probe hybridized up to 90% with RNA from two isolates of rASV. These data indicate that rASV has regained genetic information which had been deleted in the td mutants and strongly suggest that the generation of rASV involves a genetic interaction between td virus and host cell genetic information.",

    "input": "A series of tensile test pieces of the dimensions stated in the American Dental Association Specification No. 14 were produce using both nickel-base and cobalt-base removable partial denture casting alloys. Normal dental casting techniques were employed. Appropriate sections from each specimen were sectioned to half of their original thicknesses, embedded in heat-and pressure-cured conducting mounts, and polished for metallurgical examination. A double electrolytic etching technique was used, employing serially two solutions, in order to maximize the amount of metallographic detail visible. The method proved particularly valuable in the case of the nickel-base alloy as it indicated the presence of considerable interdendritic segregation. The incidence of porosity was evaluated throughout all sections of the specimens and, although found to be especially prevalent in those regions where gross shrinkage effects might be expected to occur, it was also shown to have a diffuse intergranular and interdendritic distribution.",

    "input": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the microleakage around preventive composite fillings in teeth subjected to mechanical loading and thermal cycling, and to assess the influence of the consistency of the composite resin upon the leakage. The fissure enamel was partially removed without dentin exposure in 30 extracted maxillary pre-molars. The cavities were etched with phosphoric acid and filled with undiluted composite (Adaptic) or composite diluted with varying amounts of liquid resin (Adaptic Bonding Agent). Five teeth were not acid etched and served as a control group. All teeth were mechanically loaded and unloaded, simulating masticatory forces, and subsequently thermally cycled between two dye solutions. Extensive leakage was seen around all fillings in the control group, while slight leakage, restricted to the feather-edge margin, was seen in five teeth with acid etched cavities. Three of these contained undiluted composite fillings. Twenty teeth showed no leakage. The results show that preventive composite filling provides good sealing of occlusal fissures, and that the seal is resistant to those thermal and mechanical stresses which may be expected in vivo. The use of diluted composite resin in preventive composite fillings is recommended.",

In laboratory tests, an abrasion model of tooth against filling has been simulated. The results indicate a dependence of the abrasive behaviour on the type of filler in the different composites. Composites with quartz as filler have the greatest resistance to abrasion, whereas those with lithium-aluminium-silicate show the strongest abrasion. Mean abrasion values are obtained for the composites with barium-glass or a mixture of barium-glass and quartz as filler. The resin and the two amalgams have abrasion values comparable to the abrasive resistant composites.",

The model consisted of ground sections of teeth and plane plates of silver/palladium alloy. The plates were fixed with bolts between two brass plates and with three different dimensions of the cement film between tooth and alloy, i.e. 50 micrometer, 100 micrometer and 200 micrometer. The tooth-alloy specimens were sectioned and the adaption of cements was studied with an indirect technique (replica) in a scanning electron microscope. The extent of slits was expressed as the length of all slits relative to the total length of the interface in each specimen. The results showed that the zinc phosphate cement and polycarboxylate cement exhibited a slight to moderate tendency to formation of slits at the interfaces. The EBA cement had a small extent of slits adjacent to thin cement films, but more slits were observed with increasing film thickness. The composite resin cement had a marked tendency to slit formation independent of the cement film thickness.",

    "input": "Previous studies have demonstrated that administered antibiotics must be active against major anticipated pathogens and must have reached sufficient concentrations in the tissue or body fluid at risk by the time of bacterial challenge if prophylactic therapy is to be maximally effective in reducing the infection rate of potentially contaminated surgery. The need for continuing antibiotic prophylaxis beyond the day of operation, however, has been uncertain. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind study of 220 patients undergoing elective gastric, biliary or colonic surgery, perioperative administration of cefamandole plus five days of placebo was compared to perioperative plus five days of postoperative antibiotic therapy; no significant difference was found between the groups in the rate of infection of wound (6 and 5%, respectively), peritoneum (2% each) and elsewhere (6% and 5%). In another prospective, randomized, nonblind study of 451 determinant cases of 1,624 patients undergoing emergency laparotomy, cephalothin was instituted preoperatively but after peritoneal contamination had occurred (i.e., abdominal trauma, etc.); continued postoperative antibiotic again failed to reduce further the wound and peritoneal infection rates, as noted on comparing perioperative therapy alone (infection rates 8 and 4%, respectively) with perioperative plus 5-7 days of postoperative treatment (10% and 5%, respectively). Analysis of these data, as well as of the extra expenses incurred by 463 patients because of infection in a previous prophylactic antibiotic study, revealed an average additional expenditure of $2,686.00 for each instance of postoperative infection of the wound and/or peritoneum; whereas savings of $300.00 per patient at risk were obtained whenever appropriate prophylactic antibiotic had been given.",

The seminal quality of the unilaterally cryptorchid patient is definitely impaired, although not rendered infertile, in a great majority of patients irrespective of the time of surgery. 3. The dystopic position of the maldescended testis appears to superimpose a second insult on what very likely may be an inherent abnormality in the cryptorchid testis, the latter accounting, perhaps, for its abnormal extrascrotal position. 4. Orchiopexy before the age of 5 seems advisable to ensure minimal histologic changes that may be secondary to the testis' increased exposure to elevated extrascrotal temperature. 5. The cryptorchid testis will be smaller in size irrespective of surgery, and usually correlates with significant testicular pathology. 6. Basal levels of gonadotropins, especially follicle-stimulating hormone, are likely to be elevated, but this does not necessarily imply overwhelming testicular damage. Androgen production should not be affected. 7. Surgical correction is advised when human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation fails to produce teticular descent, thereby defining the maldescended testis as not merely retractile but truly \"crytorchid.\"",

    "instruction": "What happens to the normally placed testis in the scrotum when a testis is placed into the abdomen in dogs?",
    "input": "Undescended testis is of clinical importance because there are increased risks of milignancy and torsion and disturbances of fertility and psychosexual development. New quantitative morphologic investigations show that human prepubertal testicular maturation does not occur in phases but is continuous. This made it necessary to investigate afresh the causes of disturbance of fertility and the treatment of indescended testis. Our own investigations show that damage to the germ epithelium need not be congenital but may develop because of its ectopy. If, in dogs, a testis is placed into the abdomen, not only this but also the normally placed testis in the scrotum is damaged. The diameter of the tubules and their surfaces as well as the numbers of pachtenous primary spermatocytes are significantly reduced both in the displaced and the normally placed testis. Nuclear surfaces and density of the cells involved in spermatogenesis differ from those in the controls. The findings support the plea for early hormonal or surgical treatment in order to prevent later disturbances of fertility.",
    "output": "In the context provided, when a testis is placed into the abdomen in dogs, it leads to damage not only to the displaced testis but also to the normally placed testis in the scrotum. This damage affects the tubules' diameter and surfaces, as well as the numbers of pachytene primary spermatocytes in both the displaced and the normally placed testis. Additionally, the nuclear surfaces and density of cells involved in spermatogenesis are altered compared to controls. This suggests that early hormonal or surgical treatment may be necessary to prevent later disturbances of fertility."

The secondary (6) and tertiary (7) amines strongly decrease the accumulation of NA and 5-HT in brain slices in vitro and in vivo. The cyclobutylamines also cause motor stimulation. The most potent compound in this respect is the tertiary amine 7. The increase in locomotion is not blocked by pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine, methergoline, or alpha-methyltyrosine. Pretreatment with pimozide or reserpine reduces the hyperactivity induced by 7. This hyperstimulation seems to be caused by a mechanism of action which differs from that of amphetamine. 7 may cause increase in locomotion by release of dopamine from granular stores.",
    "output": "Pretreatment with pimozide reduces the hyperactivity induced by compound 7. This suggests that the mechanism of action of compound 7, which causes motor stimulation, may involve dopamine release, similar to how pimozide works. Pimozide is an antipsychotic medication that blocks dopamine receptors, and its ability to reduce the hyperactivity induced by compound 7 implies that compound 7 may also be acting on dopamine in some way. However, the exact mechanism is not fully understood and further research would be needed to confirm this."

Membranes were observed to contain about 20 polypeptide bands ranging from 18000 to 200 000 dalton mass. Out of these, six bands were prominent and together comprised 57% of the membrane protein. When sarcolemmal membranes, phosphorylated by [gamma-(32)P] ATP in the presence of Ca(2+) or Na+ with and without K+, were fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 2.4, the band III region (Mr 105 000) of gels was found to contain active sites of monomeric Ca-ATPase and (Na,K)ATPase. Bands I (Mr greater than 200 000), II (Mr 150 000), III (Mr 105 000), and VI (Mr 47 000) were accesible to trypsin; the extent of proteolysis was dependent on the time of exposure to, and the concentration of, trypsin (i.e, ratio of sarcolemmal protein/trypsin). Addition of molar sucrose protected sarcolemmal proteins from the tryptic proteolysis. Calcium transport was reduced by the action of trypsin; the degree of reduction was influenced by the time of exposure of membranes to trypsin as well as the concentration of trypsin. (Mg,Ca)ATPase activity, on the other hand, was elevated moderately at lower concentration and reduced at higher concentration of trypsin. Treatment with phospholipase C cium transport and (Mg,Ca)ATPase activity; electrophoretic patterns were unaffected by this treatment. Addition of lecithin to phospholipase C treated membranes produced a moderate increase in calcium transport. Exposure to Triton X-100 (1%) specifically solubilized three protein bands (Mr90 000, 67 000, and 57 000), whereas exposure to deoxycholate (1%) preferentially solubilized high-molecular-weight proteins, including band III (Mr 105 000); Lubrol-PX (1%) caused nonspecific solubilization of proteins, although the extent of solubilization with Lubrol-PX was considerably less than with either Triton or deoxycholate.",
    "output": "Adding molar sucrose on the tryptic proteolysis of sarcolemmal proteins had a protective effect. This means that the presence of sucrose inhibited or slowed down the breakdown of sarcolemmal proteins by trypsin, a proteolytic enzyme. This protective effect was evident as the degree of proteolysis was reduced in the presence of sucrose. This effect might be beneficial in preserving the integrity and function of the sarcolemmal proteins, particularly those involved in calcium transport and ATPase activity. However, the exact mechanism of this protective effect and the specific proteins involved require further investigation."

    "output": "Prophylactic antibiotics can decrease the rate of acquisition of certain infections in a trauma patient, particularly those related to surgical site infections. However, it's important to note that the use of antibiotics also carries the risk of predisposing the patient to other serious infections, such as Clostridioides difficile infections. The choice of antibiotic and duration of prophylaxis should be guided by the patient's specific injury, surgical procedure, and the microorganisms most likely to cause infection in that setting."

    "instruction": "How should the diagnosis of a systemic mycosis be established?",
    "input": "Although we are all carriers of fungi, an infection is rare. Therefore, the following questions are discussed: Why do these actually saprophytic germs become pathogenic at all? Why have opportunistic fungus infections increased? The diagnosis of a fungus infection due to saprophytic pathogens is difficult, as the demonstration of a fungus does not necessarily imply disease. The case history with relevant predisposing factors is an essential clue to the diagnosis. As a matter of principle, the diagnosis of a systemic mycosis should only be established by exclusion.",
    "output": "The diagnosis of a systemic mycosis should be established by a comprehensive approach that includes a detailed case history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Since the presence of fungi does not necessarily indicate disease, it is crucial to consider relevant predisposing factors. The diagnosis should be based on the exclusion of other possible causes, as a definitive diagnosis often requires ruling out other conditions. Laboratory tests may include fungal cultures, histopathology, serology, and molecular techniques such as PCR. Imaging studies may also be useful in certain cases to identify the location and extent of the infection."

    "input": "The worldwide increase in the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases confronts the physician to an increasing extent with this group of infections. The high morbidity and the change in the clinical picture of gonorrhea, especially its asymptomatic form, give rise to extragenital complications which frequently lead the patient to the internal specialist in the first instance. Non-gonorrheal urethritis, in particular the infectious form, is undergoing intensive research. A number of organisms may be responsible, but a non-infectious origin must also be kept in mind. Syphilis is still important. The late stages of the disease have become rare thanks to highly effective therapy with antibiotics. The early stages of the infection, however, must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of any genital or anal affection, and also in generalized exanthemas of unknown origin. Homosexual transmission presents diagnostic problems of its own. Serological mass screening is essential. Interpretation of the results must take into account the different specificity of the various serological tests and their indication.",

    "instruction": "How often should the inventory of the patient's microflora be taken to help in the choice of antibiotics in cases of septicaemia of unknown aetiology?",
    "input": "Infection is an important cause of death in patients receiving cytostatic drugs or with any other impairment of host resistance. Such infections are frequently due to opportunist micro-organisms usually belonging to the endogenous flora of the patient. It is often difficult to obtain an exact diagnosis of the cause and localization of the infection. The problems associated with the prevention of infection are manifold. Exogenous infections can be prevented by proper isolation and a sterile diet. Endogenous infections can only be prevented by eradication of the patient's endogeous flora, so-called decontamination. Special attention should be given to treatment of foci of chronic infection and of the carrier state of certain microorganisms. However, the prophylactic use of antibiotics should be avoided. The curative use of antibiotics should be based on the most probable micro-organism. We consider the inventory of the patient's microflora, repeated weekly, of great help in the choice of antibiotics in cases of septicaemia of unknown aetiology. The initial therapy usually consists of a broad-spectrum combination of antibiotics, which should be bactericidal. When the causative bacteria have been isolated and the sensitivity is known, antibiotic therapy should be adjusted to the narrowest spectrum possible.",
    "output": "The context suggests that the inventory of the patient's microflora should be taken weekly to help in the choice of antibiotics in cases of septicaemia of unknown aetiology. This is done to determine the most probable microorganism causing the septicaemia, and then antibiotic therapy can be adjusted to the narrowest spectrum possible once the causative bacteria have been isolated and their sensitivity is known."

In this second part, the ethiological classification is developed. One may distinguish the post-surgical lesions, congenital defects, the side-effects of drugs and the vascular lesions. Allergy and infection are especially studied. The main problems which may be solved in a next future are: the mechanism of chronic infections, the biochemical pathology and especially the normal and pathological immunology.",

The infectious complications were concluded to present a serious problem in the treatment of leucosis, due to which their diagnosis is of essential importance for their early diagnosis, timely treatment and prophylaxis.",
    "output": "The main reason why diagnosis of infectious complications is essential in the treatment of leukemia (leucosis) is because these complications present a serious problem in the treatment of the disease.

    "instruction": "What percentage of chronic urticaria cases have no convincing etiology found?",
    "input": "Some etiologic possibilities which must be considered are foods, drugs, infection, inhalant sensitivity, psychic factors, physical agents, underlying connective tissue disease or neoplasm, insect bite or stings and genetic abnormalities. A painstaking history and a complete physical examination are, of course, mandatory. These are followed by appropriate studies for whatever etiologic factors are suggested by the history and physical examination. Certain routine or more sophisticated studies might be indicated including a complete blood count, urinalysis, stools for ova and parasites, antinuclear antibody titer, complete complement, sedimentation rate, sinus, chest and dental X rays and any other specified test depending on where the clues lead. O'Loughlin described a practical approach in the use of laboratory studies for the diagnosis of chronic urticaria. Skin tests can be helpful especially for inhalants, but food tests are usually not reliable in the diagnosis of chronic urticaria. The acute urticaria reaction to a food is clinically obvious and this type of patient does not usually seek medical attention or need extensive investigation. Treatment includes a few basic medications. Hydroxyzine (Atarax, Vistaril), which combines tranquilizer and antihistamine action, is frequently effective. Cyproheptadine HCL (Periactin) both a serotonin and histamine antagonist with anticholinergic effect, is also helpful--especially in combination with hydroxyzine. Antihistamines, ephedrine, epinephrine, aminophyllin and occasionally corticosteroids are helpful. Immunotherapy with inhalants is occasionally indicated. Eliminating possible offending foods, dyes or drugs has been previously discussed. Anti-candidal therapy and low yeast diet is effective when indicated. The final aspect of the investigation and treatment process might best be described as \"patient support\"--patience on the part of the physician. It should be realized that in 75% of the cases of chronic urticaria, no convincing etiology is found. It should also be realized that urticaria all too frequently \"settles down\" due as much to the natural course as to the careful ministrations of the physician.",

    "instruction": "What route of administration is recommended for antimicrobial agents in severe infections, at least initially?",
    "input": "In the initial therapy of life-threatening infections in which a bacterial cause is suspected, the emphasis should be on broad antibiotic coverage in contrast to definitive therapy, which is dependent on microbial isolation and, when indicated, in vitro susceptibility tests. In severe infections, antimicrobial agents should be given parenterally, at least initially. The need for optimal dosage is emphasized. This is particularly important when aminoglycosides are administered, for there is a tendency to use inadequate dosage because of concern for potential side effects with these agents. The problems leading to recurrence and persistence of fever during antimicrobial therapy include failure to diagnose and drain abscesses, superinfection, drug fever, and clinical or microbiologic errors. Combinations of antibiotics are indicated in severe infections in severe infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcal group D streptococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Laboratory aid for the selection of antimicrobial therapy can be of great value but need not always be done, because certain microorganisms have stable, predictable susceptibilities, for example, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Cautious conservatism is advocated with regard to the use of new antimicrobial agents.",
    "output": "In severe infections, at least initially, antimicrobial agents should be given parenterally. This route of administration ensures optimal dosage and rapid delivery to the site of infection. It's particularly important when aminoglycosides are administered, as there's a tendency to use inadequate dosage due to concerns about potential side effects. However, the specific route of administration for each antimicrobial agent may vary, and it's always essential to follow the manufacturer's instructions or consult with a healthcare professional for the most accurate information."

    "instruction": "What is required to prevent and manage infection in a surgical patient?",
    "input": "Infection in the surgical patient, like infection elsewhere in the body, is a manifestation of a disturbed host-bacteria equilibrium in favor of the bacteria. It results when bacteria indigenous to that patient achieve dominance over the factors of host resistance. This is reflected by a quantitative increase in the bacterial presence. To be able rationally to prevent and manage such infection requires understanding of how each prophylactic or therapeutic maneuver will work to reestablish the normal equilibrium in the specific situation in which the surgeon finds his patient.",
    "output": "To prevent and manage infection in a surgical patient, several strategies are employed to maintain the host-bacteria equilibrium in favor of the host. These include:\n\n1. Preoperative Preparation: This involves cleaning the skin around the surgical site and administering antibiotics before surgery to reduce the number of bacteria present.\n\n2. Aseptic Technique: This is a set of procedures used to prevent contamination of a wound or a surgical site. It includes the use of sterile instruments, gloves, gowns, and masks during surgery.\n\n3. Surgical Drains: These are used to drain excess fluid or pus from the surgical site, helping to prevent infection.\n\n4. Antibiotic Prophylaxis: Antibiotics are given before, during, or after surgery to kill bacteria that may cause infection. The choice of antibiotic depends on the type of surgery and the patient's sensitivity to different antibiotics.\n\n5. Wound Closure: Surgical wounds should be closed properly to prevent bacteria from entering. This can be done through sutures, staples, or skin adhesives.\n\n6. Postoperative Care: This includes monitoring the patient for signs of infection, such as fever, redness, swelling, or drainage from the surgical site. If an infection occurs, antibiotics may be administered to treat it.\n\n7. Good Nutrition and Hydration: Adequate nutrition and hydration help to strengthen the immune system, making it better able to fight off infections.\n\n8. Maintaining a Clean Environment: The surgical area and equipment should be kept clean to prevent the spread of bacteria.\n\nBy following these measures, the risk of infection can be significantly reduced in surgical patients. However, it's important to note that every patient is unique, and the specific prevention and management strategies may vary depending on the patient's health status, the type of surgery, and other factors. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice."

    "input": "Antischizophrenic agents, phenothiazine and nonphenothiazine, inhibit the transformation of the T-lymphocyte in vitro. This inhibition occurs only in the early event and is neither competitive with dopamine, nor appears to involve Na+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase. RNA synthesis is more sensitive to the inhibitory effect than DNA or protein synthesis. This leads to the conclusion that chlorpromazine may act by inhibiting the synthesis of newly formed RNA, and subsequently, transformation, rather than by alteration of the cell membrane.",
    "output": "The T-lymphocyte transformation is more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of antischizophrenic agents, such as chlorpromazine, on RNA synthesis, rather than DNA or protein synthesis. This suggests that antischizophrenic agents may primarily act by inhibiting the synthesis of newly formed RNA, which in turn affects the transformation of T-lymphocytes."

    "instruction": "What percentage of mitotic inhibition was produced by dopamine at a concentration of 1 X 10(-6) M?",
    "input": "Catecholamines produce mitotic inhibition in primary cell cultures of human keratinocytes probably via a block in the G2 part of the cell cycle. Epinephrine produced significant mitotic inhibition (49%) at a concentration as low as 4.5 X 10(-10) M, while its analog, isoproterenol, produced 47% inhibition at 1 X 10(-10) M. Norepinephrine elicited a 49% inhibitory response at 1 X 10(-8) M. One other catecholamine, dopamine, caused a 53% decrease in mitosis at 1 X 10(-6) M. Other structurally related amines to exhibit mitotic inhibition were phenylephrine, 58% at 1 X 10(-7) M; octopamine, 47% at 1 X 10(-5) M; and tyramine, 52% at 1 X 10(-4) M. Serotonin showed no mitotic inhibition at 1 X 10(-4) M. Various alpha and beta adrenergic blocking agents were added to the cell system. The alpha blocking agent, phentolamine, had no effect on mitosis. When added in conjunction with epinephrine or norepinephrine, no reduction of the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition was observed. The beta blocking agent, propranolol, by itself showed slight mitotic inhibition at 1 X 10(-6) M. When added along with epinephrine or noreinephrine, propranolol reduced the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition approximately 65%. In addition, propranolol blocked mitotic inhibition caused by phenylephrine, an alpha adrenergic agent. However, another beta blocking agent, dichloroisoproterenol, showed strong mitotic inhibition (53%) when added to the cultures at a concentration of 1 X 10(-8) M. The effect was reduced to zero in the presence of propranolol. These data suggest that while beta receptors may be involved in the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition of human keratinocytes in vitro, the nature of the receptor-molecule interaction may be complex.",
    "output": "The context provided indicates that dopamine caused a 53% decrease in mitosis at a concentration of 1 X 10(-6) M. Therefore, the percentage of mitotic inhibition produced by dopamine at a concentration of 1 X 10(-6) M is 53%."

The other inhibitors (antipain, leupeptin, ovomucoid, alpha-1 trypsin, alpha-2 macroglobulin) had little or no effect. The marked inhibitory effect of tosyl-lysine chloromethylketone could be neutralized by reduced glutathione, indicating an effect on intracellular glutathione rather than on proteases.",

The findings, which were obtained with the aid of the liquid scintillation counter and partly by means of 14C-thymidine-marked autoradiographies shows clearly that Adriamycin causes the strongest incorporation inhibition. In contrast to this, the inhibition caused by Bleomycin and arsenate is considerably less destructive. It was shown by means of cytophoto metrical examinations that Adriamycin is capable of fixing cells in the G2 phase and in the S phase. Cells react similarly to Bleomycin and arsenate. The differential inhibition of nucleic acid and protein metabolism induced by Adriamycin, Bleomycin and arsenate is correlated with a varying responsiveness of lymphocytes to the cytostatically effective substances.",

    "input": "Nicotinamide, a specific inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase, was found to be a moderate inducer of hemoglobin synthesis in Friend erythroid leukemia cells (FLC). Therefore, the effect of other inducers, s-ch as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), hexamethylene-bisacetamide (HMBA), and butyrate, on poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis was examined. The extent of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis in nuclei of FLC treated with DMSO or HMBA began to decrease before many phenotypic changes including hemoglobin production and reached 30--50% of the level of nontreated control when the cells enter the stationary phase. FLC variants unresponsive to HMBA or DMSO did not exhibit as low an activity of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis as their parent cells did by treatment with these inducers. In contrast, butyrate stimulated poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis transiently but distinctly (about 50%) at an early stage of culture (6--24 hr), but suppressed it at a later stage. Neither the cell growth nor degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) is correlated with the effect of inducers. These results suggest that the level of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis is correlated with the differentiation of FLC.",

Numbers of viable cells in cultures with and without mitogens and drugs were generally similar at beginnings and ends of experiments. Stimulated cell cultures containing combinations of drugs exhibited greater inhibition than did cultures of individual drugs. Inhibition by drugs was greater when cells were cultured in medium alone than in medium with 20% plasma. Cells exposed overnight to phenylbutazone, indomethacin, sodium aurothiomalate, or sodium meclofenamate, then washed and stimulated, responded generally as well as did cells not exposed to drugs. Because some of these drugs exhibited effects at concentrations approaching therapeutic levels, these findings may be pertinent to clinical investigations of cellular immune responses of patients on drug therapy and to possible mechanisms of action for certain drugs.",

Following their isolation from a homogenate containing the combined livers of 14C-leucine injected experimental animals and 3H-leucine injected control animals, purified fractions of the following proteins were prepared: microsomal cytochrome b5, cytochrome P-450, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and proteolipids, outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase and proteolipids, inner mitochondrial membrane cytochrome c, NADH dehydrogenase and proteolipids, intermitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5 and circulating serum albumin. The effect of a drug was examined by measuring the 14C/3H ratio of leucine incorporation of each fraction; ratios which differed markedly from a control value of 1 represented actual changes in the relative rates of protein synthesis. Increased rates of synthesis of cytochrome P-450 and its reductase, intermitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5 and all three proteolipid fractions resulted from each inducer treatment. Treatments with 3-methylcholanthrene and PCB also increased the rate of synthesis of cytochrome b5 and its reductase in both the microsome and outer mitochondrial membrane. In addition, the PCB treatment increased the rates of synthesis of cytochrome c and NADH-dehydrogenase. The rates of synthesis of cytochromes, reductases and of circulating serum albumin were inhibited following treatments with cycloheximide, aflatoxin B1 and actinomycin D. Actinomycin D appeared to inhibit the release of newly synthesized albumin into the bloodstream while chloramphenicol treatment appeared to inhibit the incorporation of cytochrome c into the mitochondria. After 20 hours of treatment with inhibitors, the inhibitory effect of actinomycin D and cycloheximide were still apparent while the rates of protein synt;esis in chloramphenicol and aflatoxin B1 treated animals increased to levels above the controls. The incorporation of radioactively labeled leucine into the proteolipids of the microsomal, and the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes were inhibited following the treatment with actinomycin D and stimulated following the treatment with cycloheximide.",

    "instruction": "What concentration of histamine was found to be a strong mitotic inhibitor in human keratinocytes?",
    "input": "Human keratinocytes grown in vitro as epithelial outgrowths or as organ cultures maintain many of their normal functions such as proliferation and keratinization. These in vitro systems have been used to analyze the effect of various agents on proliferation. All adenine nucleotides, including dibutyryl cyclic AMP, blocked mitosis in the G2 part of the cell cycle at concentrations of 1 times 10(-4) M. Some nonadenine nucleotides also showed this effect, but only at higher concentrations, an indication that the effect was specific for adenine nucleotides. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP and theophylline both depressed the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA. Catecholamines such as isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine were also potent inhibitors of mitosis (G2 block) at concentrations of 1 times 10(-8) to 1 times 10(-10) M. The fact that the effect could be blocked by the beta-blocking agent, propranolol, suggests the existence of specific membrane receptor sites. However, dichloroisoproterenol, another beta blocker, had distinct inhibitory properties in itself and thus indicated that the mechanism of action of catecholamines in human keratinocytes is complex and may involve more than binding to specific receptor sites. Histamine at a concentration of 2 times 10(-6) M was also a strong mitotic inhibitor. This finding is directly opposed to that in rat skin where mitosis is stimulated. Imidazole acetate, a histamine breakdown product, was found to be a striking mitotic stimulator in organ culture. A water-extractable protein (chalone) from human skin also caused a block in G2. Most of the substances tested occur naturally in the cell or organism and their ability to stimulate or depress proliferation in vitro suggests that they play a regulatory role in vivo.",

Simultaneously adding indomethacin (0.03-0.3 x 10(-6) M final concentration) and concanavalin A to mouse spleen cell cultures, led to an enhancement of 3H-thymidine uptake, whereas 30 x 10(-6) M indomethacin inhibited this uptake. The stimulation induced by indomethacin was higher when this drug was present in the cultures before the addition of the mitogen. Neither the optimal concanavalin A concentration nor the day on which the maximum of 3H-thymidine uptake occurred were altered by indomethacin. Activation of B lymphocytes induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide was inhibited by indomethacin at all concentrations tested. However, indomethacin similarly blocked the prostaglandin synthesis as well in lipopolysaccharide- or concanavalin A-stimulated lymphocyte cultures. Indomethacin enhanced the one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction. No significant effect of indomethacin was found on cell-mediated cytotoxicity of 51Cr labeled targets.

    "input": "Mitotic spindle inhibitors (colchicine, vinblastine, vincristine, 020, ethanol) and cytochalasin B inhibit the phagocytosis of colloid by thyroid cells and the secretion of thyroid hormones. This inhibition has been linked to interferences with the microtubular microfilament system of the follicular cell. In order to test the possibility of using such inhibitors to selectively block secretion, the action of suppressing or highly inhibitory concentrations on other metabolic parameters has been studied on dog thyroid slices in vitro: glucose oxidation, lactate formation, iodide binding to protein, cyclic 3'5' AMP accumulation. It is shown that at a concentration of 10 mM colchicine is entirely non specific as it greatly inhibits all facets of metabolism and all the stimulatory effects of cyclic 3'5' AMP and thyrotropin. The other mictrotubule inhibitors, although affecting thyroid metabolism in various ways were more specified. The enhancement by vineblastine of glucose oxidation ald iodine binding to proteins suggests an activation of they thyroid H2O2 generating system. D2O on the other hand selectively inhibits secretion and the binding of iodide to proteins. Cytochalasin B, presumably by inhibiting hexose transport, decreased glycolysis and the uptake of iodide.

Adenylate cyclase activity rose during the preleukemic and leukemic phases of leukemogenesis. Although the drop of epinephrine-induced stimulation of thymus adenylate cyclase in the preleukemic phase was probably age related, there was an additional decrease of adenylate cyclase activation by epinephrine in leukemic cells. Cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity was slightly higher in preleukemic cells and more than fourfold AKR thymus. These observations suggest that cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase is largely responsible for the low levels of cyclic AMP in leukemic cells. Significant changes in cyclic AMP metabolism are already detectable before neoplastic cells may be found in the thymus.",

Adenosine and its derivatives, such as AMP, ADP and ATP, and other cyclic nucleotides, such as cGMP, dibutyryl-cGMP, cCMP and cIMP and sodium butyrate were inactive. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor, RO-20-1724, and the adenyl cyclase stimulator, cholera enterotoxin, both markedly increased colony numbers. Studies with tritiated thymidine showed that about 50% of the cells responding to either erythropoietin (ESF) or dibutyryl cAMP (db-cAMP) were in DNA synthesis. However, by unit gravity sedimentation velocity analysis, the peak of ESF-responsive colony forming cells sedimented more rapidly (8-7 +/- 0-2 mm/hr) than the peak of db-cAMP-responsive cells (7-5 +/- 0 mm/hr). These results demonstrate that adenyl cyclase-linked mechanisms influence in vitro erythropoietic proliferation and suggest that other hormones and simple molecules might interact with surface receptors and thus modulate the action of ESF at the cellular level.",
    "output": "The phosphodiesterase inhibitor, RO-20-1724, had a stimulatory effect on erythroid colony formation in canine marrow cells. This was observed when the cells were treated with RO-20-1724, similar to the effect of the adenyl cyclase stimulator, cholera enterotoxin. This suggests that mechanisms influenced by adenyl cyclase play a role in in vitro erythropoietic proliferation, indicating potential interactions with surface receptors that could modulate the action of erythropoietin (ESF) at the cellular level."

    "input": "Cyclic 3',5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and compounds known to effect the intracellular concentrations of these nucleotides were examined for their ability to effect human neutrophil (PMN) responsiveness to chemotactic stimulation. Incubation of neutrophils with agents recognized to promote increases in intracellular cAMP in a variety of tissues (i.e., epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol, histamine, cholera toxin, and prostaglandin E-1 and E-2) or with cAMP inhibited the leukotactic response to a bacterial chemotactic factor. In contrast, cGMP and compounds which have been shown to promote increases in intracellular cGMP concentration (i.e., acetylcholine, carbamylcholine, phorbol myristate acetate, and prostaglindin F-2-alpha) markedly enhanced the neutrophil chemotactic response. The inhibitory or stimulatory influences on chemotactic responsiveness promoted by several of the agents could be shown to be blocked by a specific pharmacologic antagonist of the particular compound tested. These data support the hypothesis that cGMP and cAMP can provide opposing regulatory influences on certain cellular functions; in this case, directed motility of leukocytes.",

    "input": "Turnover of cyclic AMP was studied in intact chicken erythrocytes. Production of cyclic AMP was stimulated by adrenaline and then blocked by propranolol. The decline in the cyclic AMP concentration under these conditions is solely due to its intracellular degradation, whereas efflux of the nucleotide, although existing in these cells, does not contribute significantly to the change in its concentration. Intracellular degradation of cyclic AMP follows a first-order kinetics with a half-life of about 6 min. Similar half-lives were obtained at widely different adrenaline concentrations or when the ration of propranolol to adrenaline was varied by 25-fold. Theoretical equations were applied to calculate the rates of cyclic AMP synthesis and degradation in the intact cells under different experimental conditions. Maximal adrenaline concentrations raise the rate of cyclic AMP synthesis and its steady-state concentration by about 10-fold. The addition of caffeine causes a further 33% increase in intracellular concentration of the nucleotide, which is in good agreement with the theoretical increase computed from its slowed-down degradation.",

Chicken erythrocytes were used as target cells. Support for an inhibitory role of cyclic AMP was derived from the marked suppression of cytotoxicity by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP itself had little effect. Isoproterenol, prostaglandin E1 and prostaglandin E2 increased cyclic AMP concentrations and strongly inhibited the cytotoxic effect of the lymphocytes. Histamine showed very slight elevation of the cyclic AMP level and suppression of the cytotoxicity. Theophylline did not increase the cyclic AMP concentration, but potentiated the effects of isoproterenol and prostaglandin E1 on the cyclic AMP levels, and significantly inhibited cytotoxicity. No clear effects were seen when cyclic GMP, dibutyryl GMP, acetylcholine or carbacholine were added to the cells. The results indicate that in this system cyclic AMP inhibits cytotoxicity, while no evidence for a role of cyclic GMP has been obtained.",

The formation of cAMP increased rapidly in follicles exposed to LH. Maximum concentrations were reached after 90 min and were maintained for 180 min. Extracellular release of cAMP increased steadily throughout the 180-min experimental period. Tissue levels of cAMP increased proportionally and significantly when LH concentrations in the medium were increased from 0 to 200 mi.u. ml-1. Tissue levels of cAMP were significantly increased by HCG, prostaglandin E-2 and noradrenaline, but not by prolactin, prostaglandin F-2alpha, serotonin or melatonin. Cyclic AMP formation occurred predominantly in the thecal compartment; the membrana granulosa contributed less than 3% of the total amount of cAMP formed after gonadotrophic stimulation.

Changes in basal activity and hormone-responsiveness of adenylate cyclase were demonstrated in plasma membranes and intact cells from pre-cancerous liver of rats fed a diet containing the carcinogen 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene. Basal adenylate cyclase activity in hyperplastic parathyroid gland membranes was 200% higher than that in parathyroid adenoma membranes, corresponding with their relative rates of parathyroid hormone secretion in vitro. Membrane adenylate cyclase activity in hypernephromas was consistently 100--300% higher than in adjacent human renal cortex. Furthermore the adenylate cyclase activity of the tumour membranes was not influenced by a wide range of hormones which were effective stimulants in 'normal' renal cortex membranes. Conversion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to 1,25-dihydrocholecalciferol could not be demonstrated in either hypernephroma or adjacent renal cortical tissue. However, three of the four hypernephromas tested secreted a bone-resorbing factor. Cyclic AMP formation was increased by salmon, human and porcine calcitonins in both plasma membranes and intact cells from a poorly differentiated epidermoid cell carcinoma which was itself secreting calcitonin in culture. This phenomenon might be related to a feedback regulation of calcitonin production in this cell line. The observations are consistent with the concept of a relationship between cyclic AMP formation and certain metabolic functions (e.g. hormone production) in tumour cells.",

    "instruction": "What happens to exogenous cyclic AMP when it is incubated with embryonic chicken cartilage?",
    "input": "The role of cyclic AMP in the regulation of cartilage macromolecule synthesis in vitro was studied in pelvic cartilage from 10-12 day chick embryos. Incubation of cartilages in medium containing 0.5 mM cyclic AMP resulted in a 30% inhibition of 35SO4-2, [3H]leucine and [3H]uridine incorporation into proteoglycan, total protein and RNA, respectively. Higher concentrations of cyclic AMP had no greater effects. In contrast, butyrylated cyclic AMP derivatives (0.5-5.0 mM) added to the incubation medium stimulated (50-100%) the incorporation of these radiolabeled precursors into cartilage macromolecules. Theophylline, in concentrations (0.1-0.5 mM) which raise intracellular cyclic AMP, also increases the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors into macromolecules. The data indicate that exogenous cyclic AMP and butyrylated cyclic AMP derivatives have paradoxical effects on cartilage macromolecule synthesis. Butyrylated cyclic AMP derivatives, not exogenous cyclic AMP, mimic the effects of intracellular cyclic AMP. Incubation of embryonic chicken cartilage with exogenous cyclic AMP results in the extracellular degradation of the cyclic AMP to adenosine. Adenosine (0.125 mM) inhibits precursor incorporation into cartilage macromolecules. The metabolism of exogenous cyclic AMP generates sufficient adenosine to account for the observed inhibitory effects of exogenous cyclic AMP on cartilage macromolecule synthesis. Butyrylated cyclic AMP derivatives are not degraded during incubation with cartilage. The data indicate that cartilage is a tissue in which the effect of cyclic AMP is to stimulate anabolic processes.",
    "output": "When exogenous cyclic AMP is incubated with embryonic chicken cartilage, it is degraded to adenosine. This degradation leads to a 30% inhibition of the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors into proteoglycan, total protein, and RNA, respectively. In contrast, butyrylated cyclic AMP derivatives are not degraded during incubation with cartilage and stimulate the incorporation of these radiolabeled precursors into cartilage macromolecules. This suggests that butyrylated cyclic AMP derivatives, not exogenous cyclic AMP, mimic the effects of intracellular cyclic AMP and stimulate anabolic processes in cartilage."

    "instruction": "What happens to AFC precursors when they respond to antigen in the absence of T-cell activity?",
    "input": "The intracellular ratio of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) to guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP) may control the developmental pathway followed by antibody-forming cell (AFC) precursors. The evidence for this is derived from several different types of experiments. First lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which is mitogenic for B lymphocytes, stimulates rapid, transient changes in intracellular levels of cyclic GMP but not cyclic AMP when added to mouse spleen cultures. Cyclic GMP itself stimulates DNA synthesis in these cultures, suggesting that the intracellular changes in cyclic GMP levels are involved in the mitogenic signal delivered by LPS to cells. The absolute amounts of cyclic nucleotides may vary widely in different cells under various conditions, however, the intracellular ratio of cyclic AMP to cyclic GMP is always high in nondividing cells and low in dividing cells. AFC precursors appear to respond to antigen in the absence of T-cell activity by inactivation (1-7). In the response to antigen in the presence of specific T cells, precursor cells proliferate and mature to AFC. Raising intracellular levels of cyclic AMP inhibits cell proliferation and leads to precursor cell inactivation (14, 15). It is suggested that the interaction of antigen with immunoglobulin receptors on the surface of precursors cells leads to the stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity and initiates the inactivation pathway. Since cyclic GMP stimulates immune responses in T-cell-depleted cultures (14, 15) and increasing cyclic GMP levels appear to be involved in the delivery of a mitogenic signal to cells, it is suggested that T-helper cells deliver a signal to precursor cells via the stimulation of guanylate cyclase to initiate the inductive pathway. It is suggested that it is the intracellular ratio of cyclic AMP to cyclic GMP that regulates the fate of precursor cells, not the absolute level of one cyclic nucleotide.",
    "output": "In the absence of T-cell activity, AFC precursors respond to antigen by inactivation. This inactivation is thought to be initiated by the stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity, which results in an increase in intracellular levels of cyclic AMP. High levels of cyclic AMP are known to inhibit cell proliferation and lead to precursor cell inactivation. In contrast, T-helper cells, in the presence of T-cell activity, are suggested to deliver a signal to precursor cells via the stimulation of guanylate cyclase, leading to an increase in intracellular levels of cyclic GMP. This increase in cyclic GMP levels is associated with the delivery of a mitogenic signal and the initiation of the inductive pathway, leading to precursor cell proliferation and maturation to AFC. Therefore, it is the intracellular ratio of cyclic AMP to cyclic GMP that appears to regulate the fate of precursor cells, not the absolute level of one cyclic nucleotide."

    "input": "The involvement of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) in the regulation of the cell cycle was studied by determining intracellular fluctuations in cAMP levels in synchronized HeLa cells and by testing the effects of experimentally altered levels on cell cycle traverse. Cyclic AMP levels were lowest during mitosis and were highest during late G-1 or early S phase. These findings were supported by results obtained when cells were accumulated at these points with Colcemid or high levels of thymidine. Additional fluctuations in cAMP levels were observed during S phase. Two specific effects of cAMP on cell cycle traverse were found. Elevation of cAMP levels in S phase or G-2 caused arrest of cells in G-2 for as long as 10 h and lengthened M. However, once cells reached metaphase, elevation of cAMP accelerated the completion of mitosis. Stimulation of mitosis was also observed after addition of CaCl2. The specificity of the effects of cAMP was verified by demonstrating that: (a) intracellular cAMP was increased after exposure to methylisobutylxanthine (MIX) before any observed effects on cycle traverse; (b) submaximal concentrations of MIX potentiated the effects of isoproterenol; and (c) effects of MIX and isoproterenol were mimicked by 8-Br-cAMP. MIX at high concentrations inhibited G-1 traverse, but this effect did not appear to be mediated by cAMP. Isoproterenol slightly stimulated G-1 traverse and partially prevented the MIX-induced delay. Moreover, low concentrations of 8-Br-cAMP (0.10-100 muM) stimulated G-1 traverse, whereas high concentrations (1 mM) inhibited. Both of these effects were also observed with the control, Br-5'-AMP, at 10-fold lower concentrations.",

Humoral responses have been monitored using assays for antibodies against tumor specific as well as tumor associated antigens. Assays have been developed which are capable of detecting circulating fetal antigens in very small concentrations. Thus far no one assay technique has proven to be sufficiently sensitive nor specific to be clinically useful. However, by utilizing a battery of tests before, during and after treatment, it is possible to determine a great deal about individual patient response to treatment and prognosis.

In general, assays are selected for their reliability, i.e. fairly standard within a normal population; that are capable of detecting subtle differences in immune status; and are specific for particular aspects of the immune system. Since normal immune responses are directly dependent upon at least three distinct subpopulations of lymphocytes, macrophages and their cooperative interactions as well as a number of indirect factors, it is essential to study multiple parameters to properly evaluate the effects of environmental chemicals on the immune system. Immunologic assessment is further complicated by the fact that the immune effects will vary dependent upon the chemical and dosage level as well as the species and age of the experimental animals.",

Some of the antigens detected in vitro induce transplantation resistance in vivo, while others do not. Human neuroblastoma cells cultivated in vitro have been shown to possess common antigens to which lymphocytes from neuroblastoma patients react. Whether it is possible to augment the immune reactivity of patients with neuroblastoma to these common antigens and, if so, whether this heightened immune reactivity would have clinically beneficial effects are as yet unknown. These reactions are complex, involving both cellular and humoral mechanisms. The fact that one type of immune response can be detected to one type of antigen present in a tumor in vitro does not necessarily mean that the immune response is effective in vivo. Responses to other tumor antigens may be deficient, or the immune response may be depressed. This may be due to active suppression of and/or selective deficiencies in critical cell populations required for an augmented immune response; this possibility may be evaluated with techniques allowing for in vitro sensitization to tumor antigens.",

Fragmentations of the CN peptides were accomplished by digestions with trypsin (after citraconylation or 1,2-cyclohexanedione treatment), chymotrypsin and Staphylococcus aureus external protease. Hydrolysis of unreduced material by pepsin and thermolysin, performed in order to determine the S-S bridge positions, provided useful overlapping peptides. The glycan moiety of lipase is bound to Asn-166. The non-essential tyrosine specifically blocked by diisopropylphosphorofluoridate is Tyr-49 in a cluster of asparagine and glutamine residues. The existence of a highly hydrophobic sequence (206--217) at the C terminus of the CNII fragment is noteworthy.",

    "instruction": "How many unique residues were deduced in the primary structure of the protein monomer?",
    "input": "Eight different types of peptide mixtures from [14C]carboxymethylated yeast alcohol dehydrogenase were obtained using trypsin with or without prior maleylation of the substrate, chymotrypsin, pepsin, microbial proteases or CNBr. Each mixture was fractionated by exclusion chromatography and peptides were further purified on paper. From results of analyses of all fragments it seems possible to to deduce a primary structure of 347 unique residues in three segments. Together, the segments can account for the whole protein monomer with the exception of a small connecting region. Many unfavourable structures complicated the determination and made single sequence conclusions tentative, but known data are consistent and for most segments of the monomer results are abundant. Several microheterogeneities in the protein are indicated and one apparent amino acid exchange is characterized, suggesting that different types of subunits occur. This may probably be correlated with genetic polymorphism in yeast. Multiple desamidations are also characterized and a few of these affect particularly labile structures. Many residues are unevenly distributed and unexpected patterns are shown. Elements of repetitive sequences occur, reducing the uniqueness of structures. Hydrophobic segments are found, and the uncharacterized region is, at least in some subunits, in a core-like tryptic segment. These and other aspects of the structure may explain some properties of the monomer, and form the background for evolutionary, structural and functional correlations with related enzymes.",
    "output": "From the context provided, it is stated that it seems possible to deduce a primary structure of 347 unique residues in three segments for the protein monomer. However, the text also mentions that many unfavorable structures and microheterogeneities in the protein were found, which may have complicated the determination and made single sequence conclusions tentative. Therefore, while 347 unique residues are mentioned, it's important to note that the actual number could potentially be slightly different due to these complications."

As a result, almost the entire sequence has been obtained. The overlap with key cyanogen bromide fragments has also allowed us to propose an order for the first 198 residues of the fibrinogen alpha chain.

No effect of GABA on extracranial blood vessels was observed. The GABA-induced dilation could be blocked in a dose-dependent manner by either bicuculline or picrotoxin. The latter agent appeared to act as a competitive antagonist. GABA agonists muscimol, imidazoleacetic acid, delta-aminovaleric acid, (+/-)gamma-amino-beta-hydroxybutyric acid, and beta-alanine also relaxed actively contracted cerebral arteries dose-dependently. The relative potency of these agonists was consistent with that established for GABA receptors on neurons and invertebrate striated muscle. GABA was also tested on two human cerebral arteries and found to cause a small dilation. The results support the existence of a cerebrovascular GABA receptor which may mediate an interaction between GABA and the cerebral circulatory system.",

    "input": "gamma-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) were applied microiontophoretically near spontaneously active cells in the substantia nigra and the neocortex of chloral hydrate-anaesthetized rats. Whereas GABA in \"low doses\" (i.e. 20 nA ejection currents) depressed the activity of cells in both areas, GBH reduced the firing rate only when the compound was expelled with two to three times higher ejection currents. Under these conditions GHB depressed about half of the nigral but the majority of the neocortical cells tested. The depressant action of GABA was readily antagonized by microiontophoretic bicuculline methiodide whereas the effects of GHB were resistant to this alkaloid. Intraperitoneally administered GHB in doses of 300 and 600 mg/kg reduced the firing rate of the majority of spontaneously active neocortical cells. In conclusion, GHB inhibits the firing of nigral and neocortical neurons. However its effects are not mediated through the activation of bicuculline-sensitive GABA receptors.",

    "input": "gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), a pharmacologically active central nervous system constituent, has been postulated to function as a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist. This hypothesis was tested directly on GABAergic synapses in isolated, superfused frog spinal cord. Addition of GHB to the superfusate produced effects on primary afferent terminals that were distinctly different from the effects of GABA. Thus, although both compounds depressed dorsal root potentials, GHB hyperpolarized terminals while GABA depolarized the same structures. The GABA responses were antagonized by bicuculline and picrotoxin, but these alkaloids did not change GHB's actions. In addition, GHB altered neither high-affinity uptake by cord slices, nor potassium-evoked release of tritiated GABA from them. GHB did not directly release GABA from spinal slices preloaded with [3H]GABA. These observations suggest that the central nervous system actions of GHB are not dependent upon its ability to activate GABAergic synapses or to modify GABAergic mechanisms.",
    "output": "In the isolated frog spinal cord, GHB (gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid) had a distinct effect on primary afferent terminals compared to GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). While GABA depolarized these terminals, GHB hyperpolarized them. Furthermore, the effects of GHB were not antagonized by bicuculline and picrotoxin, which are antagonists of GABAergic synapses. This suggests that the central nervous system actions of GHB are not dependent upon its ability to activate GABAergic synapses or to modify GABAergic mechanisms."

This paper reviews the hypothesis that benzodiazepines act via GABA-ergic mechanisms in the central nervous system. At NIMH in Washington D.C. a novel method to measure the turnover rate of GABA in rat brain nuclei has been developed (Bertilsson et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 200: 277, 1977). The incorporation of 13C from glucose into glutamic acid and GABA was quantitated in stereomicroscopically isolated nuclei. Using this technique it was shown that the GABA agonist muscimol and diazepam have a similar action. Both drugs decreased the turnover rate of GABA in N. caudatus and accumbens, but not in globus pallidus (Mao et al., Biol. Psychiatry 12: 395, 1977). This gives further support to the theory that diazepam acts as a GABA-mimetic drug.",
    "output": "The neurotransmitter that has been the major focus of interest in recent years regarding the influence of benzodiazepines is gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This is because benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, have been shown to act as GABA-mimetic drugs, influencing the turnover rate of GABA in certain brain nuclei, as demonstrated in the study mentioned in the context."

Circling parallels the imbalance of GABA concentrations between the injected and the noninjected side of the brain, being most striking on Day 1 and 3, and non-existent by Day 7. Increases in GABA concentration were demonstrated in areas distant from the injection site, on both the injected and noninjected side of the brain presumably due to diffusion of the ethanolamine O-sulphate. This diffusional effect made it impossible to define the exact site of GABA and dopamine interaction.",

    "input": "1 Recent studies have demonstrated growing evidence for a primary action of the benzodiazepines on gabaminergic neurones which induces a facilitation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated neurotransmission. As enhancement of GABA release has been suggested to account for their activation of GABA mechanisms, the effect of diazepam and clobazam, and of several other psychotropic drugs, on stimulated GABA release have been studied. 2 Using rat brain cortex slices saturated with [3H]-GABA, the electrically stimulated overflow of GABA is reduced in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of both diazepam and clobazam. 3 The benzodiazepine-induced reduction in GABA overflow during electrical stimulation is antagonized by the GABA receptor blocker bicuculline, whereas bicuculline alone at 10(-6) M concentration does not change the overflow. 4 Among some other centrally active drugs tested, hexobarbitone and the 'second messenger; cyclic GMP also induce a significant but less marked reduction in GABA release. 5 A schematic model of a central gabaminergic synapse is proposed, which may explain the benzodiazepine effects on stimulated GABA release by suggesting an inhibitory feedback control of transmitter release mediated by presynaptic GABA receptors ('autoreceptors').",
    "output": "The effect of bicuculline alone at 10(-6) M concentration on the electrically stimulated overflow of GABA is that it does not change the overflow. This is because bicuculline is a GABA receptor antagonist, but at this specific concentration, it does not induce any change in GABA release on its own. However, when combined with benzodiazepines, it antagonizes the benzodiazepine-induced reduction in GABA overflow during electrical stimulation."

Likewise, GABA and glycine depressed ongoing phasic neural activity of both inspiratory and expiratory units. In this case, however, the dosage of GABA required to produce a given depression was significantly less than the required dosage of glycine.

    "input": "Electrophysiological investigations of others show that pentobarbital enhances the inhibitory inflences of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Specifically, receptor activation is amplified and prolonged, suggesting the presence of an increased number of GABA molecules in the synaptic cleft. Either inactivation of high-affinity GABA transport or alteration of post-synaptic GABA receptors might account for these influences of pentobarbital. In this sudy the effect of pentobarbital on high-affinity uptake and binding of GABA to synaptic receptive sites has been examined. Using synaptosomes and subsynaptosomal fractions of cerebral cortex and hippocampus, it si shown that concentrations of pentobarbital, exceeding 1 mM have no appreciable effect on GABA uptake or binding. Thus the synaptic influence of pentobarbital, evident at 0.1 mM in electrophysiologic experiments, must originate from mechanisms other than the high-affinity uptake or binding of GABA. Possible sites of action include the presynaptic release of GABA and the ionophores coupled with postsynapitc sites.",

Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels rose gradually to maximal values by 6-13 hours and maintained this level until the end of the infusions. Testosterone (T) levels revealed gradual increases throughout the infusions. These results confirm an increase in serum T levels with prolonged endogenous gonadotrophin stimulation. This is in contrast to the inability of several previous studies to demonstrate an increase in T levels following the relatively short gonadotrophin elevation produced by single-shot LH-RH administration. The T increases produced, however, were quantitatively much less than those reported during prolonged LH-RH infusions in rams, suggesting that the human testis is less responsive to endogenous gonadotrophin stimulation than is that of the ram.

Small, but significant, LH response to LHRH was observed 6-10 days after delivery, and gradually returned to normal thereafter, though the response was poor during the first 35 days of the puerperal period when compared with that of the controls. On the other hand, no FSH response to LHRH was observed until 16-25 days after delivery, when the response was greater than that of the controls.",

    "input": "Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) was administered to prepubertal male rats (intact, castrate or castrate-adrenalectomized, 60 g body weight) for 28 days (1 microgram LH-RH/day, s.c.), at a 10-fold physiological dose, as compared to the minimal FSH-releasing dose of 100 ng/rat s.c. In intact rats, serum LH and weight of androgen-dependent organs (vented prostate, seminal vesicles) were reduced after 14 days of treatment. In castrate rats, the postcastration rise in serum LH was abolished by treatment. Pituitary LH content, FSH secretion and prolactin secretion were not suppressed. Hypothalamic LH-RH was increased at 14 and 21 days. In castrate adrenalectomized male rats, LH secretion was also suppressed by 1 microgram LH-RH s.c. x 28 days. The hypothalamic LH-RH content did not increase. The pituitary LH-RH receptor level was not down-regulated after 14 days treatment either in intact or castrate male rats. Pituitary inhibition (LH release) in rats by a supraphysiological dose of LH-RH given for 28 days indicates that the optimal regime for chronic treatment has to be determined by monitoring LH release at regular intervals. Direct pituitary inhibition by LH-RH may explain some of the unexpected antifertility effects observed with high doses of LH-RH.",

In seven of the women, follicle-stimualating hormone (FSH) levels were at the limit of sensitivity of the assay and there was no response to LH-RH. One postpartum subject tested three weeks after delivery did show an FSH response to LH-RH. The thyrotropin response to TRH was within normal limits. When compared with control subjects, the pregnant and puerperal women had elevated basal levels of prolactin and an exaggerated response to TRH. Growth hormone levels were low and there was an inconsistent response to the administration of the releasing hormones. These results indicate that in pregnancy the thyrotroph and lactotroph are responsive to stimulation, whereas the gonadotroph is suppressed.",

    "input": "Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone and androstenedione were measured by radioimmunoassays in the sera of immature male rats treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH). A single dose of 10, 20, 40 or 80 ng of LH-RH produced a prompt increase in serum LH: signfiicant changes in FSH were found only with the two larger doses. Serum testosterone increased to peak levels in 20 to 40 min and returned to control level by 120 min. Changes in androstenedione were temporally similar but smaller in magnitude. Four doses of 20 or 40 ng LH-RH given at 20 min intervals did not increase serum LH or testosterone concentrations above those found with a single injection; FSH was slightly higher after the fourth dose. However, 40 ng LH-RH given every 20 min for 2 h produced a dramatic increase in serum LH and FSH: serum and testicular androgens were also much higher during the second hour. A 2 h stimulation with 80 ng LH-RH given ip at 30 min intervals did not alter the response to the same treatment given 24 h later; i.e., neither the pituitary nor the gonad was primed by previous exposure to increased levels of LH-RH or gonadotrophins. These results suggest that a single pulse of LH-RH produces a predictable response in the animal, but multiple episodic stimuli produce variable responses: testes, on the other hand, produce androgens as long as gonadotrophins are available.",

Treatment for 7 days significantly (P less than 0.02) inhibited maturational increases in the pituitary content and serum concentration of gonadotrophins, testicular luteinizing hormone (LH)-receptor concentration and the testicular capacity to secrete testosterone; the pituitary content and serum concentration of prolactin, the hypothalamic content of LH-RH and testicular weight were unaffected. In rats treated with LH-RH agonist, the initial (2 to 3 days) reduction in testicular LH-receptors and the capacity to secrete testosterone probably resulted from acutely raised levels of LH in the blood, whilst later effects may have resulted from the apparently chronic reduction in serum gonadotrophin levels. The latter may reflect a decrease in pituitary responsiveness to repeated stimulation with LH-RH agonist. Despite the extensive loss of testicular LH-receptors and diminished responsiveness, the concentration of HCG which significantly (P less than 0.05) increased testosterone secretion by the testis in vitro was the same (2 pmol/l) as that for testes from control rats.",

A maximal inhibitory effect was seen after a dose of only 40 ng of the peptide. No consistent effect of the LHRH analog was seen on ovarian prolactin receptors. When the analog was injected on day 7 of pregnancy, the inhibition of ovarian LH/hCG receptors was of shorter duration and was much less sensitive than that in nonpregnant animals. These data indicate that ovarian LH and FSH receptors levels are highly sensitive to changes in endogenous gonadotropin secretion and suggest that the gonadotropin surge occurring spontaneously on proestrus may play an important role in the regulation of ovarian gonadotropin receptors during the estrous cycle.",

Based on a cumulative statistical analysis 0,5% intraoperative complications required laparotomy, the main indications being haemorrhages and bowel injuries.

The failure rate of the laparoscopic electrocoagulation of the fallopian tube after a long-term follow-up was about 0,5%, 20--25% of these were ectopic pregnancies. The transection of the fallopian tubes did not diminish the pregnancy rate, but the risk of bleeding was considerably higher with this technic.

    "input": "Laparoscopic tubal sterilization has been rapidly gaining acceptance as a nonpuerperal method of permanent fertility control. A number of problems have nonetheless been associated with this technique. For example, tubal destruction often exceeds that necessary for tubal occlusions, increasing the danger of thermal injuries and possibly such dysfunctional disorders as abnormal uterine bleeding and dysmenorrhea. Furthermore, excessive destruction precludes any possibility of later tubal reconstruction. In an attempt to avoid these problems, a new low-voltage unit with a rechargeable battery was evaluated. With this unit, cautery is provided under laparoscopic view with a spring-activated hook which retracts the fallopian tube into a Teflon shield, where it is coagulated and transected. Histopathologic studies of the healthy fallopian tubes of four women in their reproductive years treated by this method while the abdomen was open prior to an elective hysterectomy demonstrated minimal destruction of the mesosalpinx, with complete tubal occlusion and a coagulated area 10 mm in length. One hundred and sixty-five patients have been sterilized successfully by this method. Indications are that it may provide safe tubal occlusion without unnecessary destruction of the fallopian tubes and surrounding vasculature.",

Surgical difficulties were reported for about 13.0% of the procedures, and surgical complications, of which the most frequent was torn or bleeding tubes, occurred in 2.0% of the cases. Pregnancy rates were significantly higher for patients whose tubes were occluded by tantalum clips (7.7 per 100 women at 12 months), indicating that this is not the preferred technique of tubal occlusion; the 12-month life table pregnancy rates were 0.1 per 100 women for tubal ring and 0.0 for Pomeroy and fimbriectomy.

    "input": "Control of diabetes from complete normalisation to less adequate degrees of metabolic regulation needs to be assessed with regard to conditions of evaluation and to severity of the disease. Under optimal conditions the therapeutic events should occur with well-timed regularity. Different assessment criteria are appropriate depending on the severity of the deficiency of endogenous insulin. Plasma and urine glucose and ketone body measurements remain the practical standards for assessing diabetic control. Abnormalities of lipid and protein metabolites serve to augment the scope of the assessment. Triglycerides and haemoglobin AIc are also useful indicators of control. In mild (Type II) diabetes it may be possible to achieve normal plasma glucose measurements two hours after meals. Such aims carry a risk of hypoglycaemia in severe (Type I) diabetes. Normoglycaemia and aglycosuria in severe diabetes are feasible only preprandially in most cases. The use of urine glucose tests requires evaluation of blood-to-urine glucose relationships. Practical and convenient methods for identifying patients with high or low \"renal thresholds\" are described.

Overnight basal normoglycaemia has been obtained with markedly reduced plasma-glucose levels during the day. Plama-triglyceride levels have become normal in most patients. The required insulin dose need not be determined empirically, but can be calculated from the basal plasma-glucose level and the degree of obesity.

In contrast to true diabetic subjects, an elevated ratio of insulin to glucose during the glucose tolerance test is consistently observed indicating a peripheral insulin insensitivity. Among the possible reasons, a disturbance at the cellular level seems to be most likely. There is some evidence of reduced peripheral glucose utilization on the one hand and increased hepatic glucose output--probably by stimulation of gluconeogenesis--on the other. Agents that have been suggested to be involved in these alterations of carbohydrate metabolism in uremia are hormones, electrolytes, pH, and \"toxic\" metabolic intermediates or end-products. Of these, an increase in insulin antagonistic hormones; among them growth hormone, catecholamines, and glucagon, seems to be of most significance. Although for the individual hormones no equivocal correlation with glucose intolerance has been proved, the interaction of all of them may result in a preponderance of insulin antagonism thus leading to an apparent insulin resistance.",

    "input": "The prevailing concept of etiologic heterogeneity for the diabetes mellitus syndrome is one of multiple genetic factors interacting with a variety of environmental influences. Variation in expression of the disorder, particularly the need for insulin, does not correlate with known etiologic distinctions. There is much evidence for genetic heterogeneity, as well as phenotypic variation when etiology can be presumed to be identical. The vascular manifestations of diabetes include microangiopathy unique to diabetes and larger vessel disease that differs from that of normal aging only by its prematurity. There is as much evidence for heterogeneity of the vascular expression as there is for glucose intolerance. Approximately 25% of persons with insulin-dependent diabetes may never develop the microvascular disease. The pathogenesis of vascular disease in diabetes may involve a number of abnormalities of plasma, circulating cells, and vascular tissue. Were absolute control of glycemia possible, some of the contributing factors involved in vasculopathy would possibly be alleviated. In the absence of automated physiologic insulin replacement the potential deleterious effect of our current methods of treatment might be reduced by specific inhibition of excess catecholamine, growth hormone and/or glucagon responses.",

A great advance in therapy is the development of the monocomponent insulins. They are primarily indicated in the labile forms, especially in infantile and juvenile diabetes, in insulin resistance, for high antiinsulin titiers, insulin allergy, lipoatrophy and microangiopathy.

These abnormalities are : hyperreactivity of A-cells to arginine, non suppressibility by glucose, and absence of stimulation following hypoglycemia. 2) These abnormalities appear as secondary in most instances : a) A-cells behave in a normal way in most studies with prediabetics ; b) plasma glucagon concentration is normalized by excellent control of diabetes or following prolonged insulin infusion. High doses of insulin are required most of the times to obtain a normalization of A-cell function : in insulin-dependent diabetics, the physiological portoperipheral insulin gradient no longer exists, and the high doses of insulin which are necessary may be the only mean to reconstitute the high insulin concentrations supposed to be present at the A-cell level. 3) Conflicting results have been collected about the role of this glucagon excess in aggravating the diabetic metabolic syndrome.

The variation of insulin absorption and effect of insulin antibodies on the free insulin levels achieved after exogenous insulin injections have been demonstrated.

The incidence of thyroid disease was found to be increased in 1779 insulin deficient diabetics of all ages and persistence of islet-cell antibodies suggests that the diabetes may be due to autoimmunity in some of these patients.",

DNA synthesis was inhibited after 12 hours of incubation. The normal course of cell division was completely supressed with a concentration of 3.2 . 10(-2) mol/l. A decrease in protein synthesis was observed after 24 hours of incubation. This decrease may be considered the result of DNA inhibition.",

    "instruction": "What is the effect of cycloheximide treatment on lactate levels in the medium from insulin-stimulated CEF?",
    "input": "Temporal inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide prevents subsequent insulin, but not serum-stimulated DNA synthesis in G1-arrested chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF). The inhibition is measured by the incorporation of 3H-thymidine into acid insoluble material and confirmed by chemical estimate of the DNA content of inhibited and uninhibited cells. Cycloheximide treatment is without effect if the cell cultures are maintained at 4 degrees C while exposed to the drug. Several alpha-keto acids (pyruvate, oxaloacetate, alpha-ketobutyrate) at 0.5-1 mM concentrations restore DNA synthesis in previously inhibited cells when combined with insulin. L-alanine (D-alanine is inert) is even more effective than the keto acids in stimulating DNA synthesis after cycloheximide treatment. Glucose transport was unaffected by cycloheximide treatment while lactate levels in medium from inhibited, insulin-stimulated CEF were reduced 70% compared to uninhibited counterparts. We speculate that cycloheximide treatment may lead to the decay of a glycolytic enzyme which compromises the ability of inhibited cells to synthesize pyruvate from glucose, and thus induces an exogenous requirement for alpha-keto acid or L-alanine. A serum component(s) with a molecular weight of about 100 permitted insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis in inhibited cells.",
    "output": "Cycloheximide treatment on lactate levels in the medium from insulin-stimulated CEF results in a reduction of about 70% compared to uninhibited cells. This decrease in lactate levels might be due to the decay of a glycolytic enzyme caused by cycloheximide treatment, which compromises the ability of inhibited cells to synthesize pyruvate from glucose. However, the cells still have an exogenous requirement for alpha-keto acids or L-alanine to stimulate DNA synthesis after cycloheximide treatment."

    "instruction": "What percentage of cells in serum-deprived cultures growing at a very low rate become labeled upon continuous, prolonged exposure to 3H-thymidine?",
    "input": "Chick embryo cells which have been kept overnight at pH 6.8 in the absence of serum multiply very slowly. Only a small fraction of cells is in the S period at any given time, and the rate of uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose is very low. Upon raising the pH to 7.4 and adding serum (\"turn-on\") the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose increases immediately; the rate of DNA synthesis increases after a lag of about 4 hours, and represents an increase in the fraction of cells synthesizing DNA. the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose is rapidly returned to its original low rate at any time by again lowering the pH and removing serum (\"turn-off\"). The synthesis of DNA in the culture remains constant or continues to rise at a markedly reduced rate following the same treatment. Lowering pH or removing serum independently of each other is less efficient at inhibiting the increase in DNA synthesis than the combined treatment but each accomplishes a similar result. Cultures which have been \"turned-off\" during the early stages of the rapid increase in DNA synthesis, resume their prior rate of increase immediately if \"turned-on\" again within 2.5 hours. If the cultures have been \"turned-off\" for 5.5 hours before restoring the \"turn-on\", there is a 2 hour delay before they resume an increased rate of DNA synthesis. The results until shortly before, or at the time of the onset of the S period. Up to 96% of the cells in post-confluent cultures growing in conventional medium become labeled upon continuous, prolonged exposure to 3H-thymidine. Seventy-eight percent of the cells in serum-deprived cultures growing at a very low rate become labeled. These and other considerations suggest that the inhibition of cell multiplication by high population density or serum deprivation is caused by a lengthening of the time cells remain in the prereplicative G1 period rather than by shifting cells into a qualitatively distinct G0 period. There may, however, be a period common to all cells regardless of growth rate, in which cells are not progressing toward the S period. The length of this variable period would then determine the growth rate of a population of cells.",
    "output": "Approximately 78% of cells in serum-deprived cultures growing at a very low rate become labeled upon continuous, prolonged exposure to 3H-thymidine.

    "input": "Full-thickness skin plugs from immature and adult rats have been shown to incorporate -3H-thymidine in vitro in a semisynchronous fashion for up to 54 hr. DNA synthesis is minimal at 16 hr post sacrifice but increases again at 24 and 48 hr, and cells in S phase at 48 hr have passed through at least one mitosis in vitro (between 32 and 39 hr). Advantage can be taken of this semisynchronous burst of DNA synthetic activity to test the effects of potential inhibitors of skin cell proliferation, and to determine at which phase of the cell cyclic these inhibitors act. High concentrations of epinephrine or isoproterenol (10--5 M) are required to cause inhibition but the effect is specific for the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Propranolol does not demonstrate beta-antagonism in this system, since it is a very potent inhibitor acting in G1 phase. Dibutyryl cycle AMP and theophylline have two effects: one is a specific inhibitory action on cells in the G2 phase and the second is a short-term action limiting thymidine uptake by cells in S phase without affecting the transition of cells from G1 to S.",

    "input": "Cellular growth has been found to be directly related to the amount of sodium pumping activity in mouse lymphoblasts (L5178-Y) cultured in varying concentrations of the cardiac glycoside, ouabain. No short-term adaptation (within one generation) occured; i.e., neither growth rate nor (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity increased in cells cultured for  1-2 days in ouabain. Growth inhibition commenced after two hours, occurring concomitantly with decreased 3H-leucine incorporation into protein. The time course of this inhibition of protein synthesis, measured by leucine incorporation was similar to, but slightly slower than the time course or the dissipation of the sodium gradient. On the other hand, 3H-thymidine incorporation is unaffected by ouabain treatment over the same period. The uptake of 3H-alanine, a neutral amino acid thought to be transported via a Na+-dependent carri-r, was depressed concurrently with the sodium gradient dissipation. It is suggested, therefore, that ouabain inhibition of cellular growth results primarily from the dissipation of the sodium gradient leading to decreased Na+-dependent transport of amino acids (e.g., alanine) and, therefore, decreased protein synthesis, as observed by leucine incorporation. A sensitive and rapid method for determining ouabain inhibition of cell volume regulation is also described, which may prove potentially useful for assaying Na pump activity.",
    "output": "Ouabain treatment causes a decrease in protein synthesis in mouse lymphoblasts, as indicated by the reduced 3H-leucine incorporation. However, the incorporation of 3H-thymidine, which is associated with DNA synthesis, remains unaffected by ouabain treatment. This suggests that ouabain's effect on cellular growth is primarily due to its impact on protein synthesis, rather than DNA synthesis. The dissipation of the sodium gradient, which occurs concurrently with the inhibition of protein synthesis, is thought to be the primary cause of these effects."

    "input": "This study was concerned with the course of DNA synthetic activity (3H-TdR-LI-method) in the buccal mucosa of adult male. Sprague Dawley rats over an incubation period of 5 h. Interest was focussed on the influences of different media and, in particular, on temoporary changes in the proliferative activity. 3H-LI were compared in specimens (a) kept in active (= i.e., 3H-thymidine containing) medium throughout their respective incubation period and (b) pre-incubated in inactive medium for varying, but clearly defined periods before being transferred into active medium for 30 min (actual 3H-LI). Independent of the medium used the rate of DNA synthesis was markedly lowered at 60 min, the reduction being more or less significant in the different media. This was due to a temporary inhibition of DNA synthesis, which was restored after 120-180 min. In contrast, the blockade of G2-phase and/or mitosis persisted up to the end of incubation, as indicated by the unchanged number of labelled mitotic figures after 120 min. Addition of glutamine to Mc Coy's 5A markedly enhanced the activity of 3H-thymidine incorporation, but could not prevent the temporary inhibition of DNA synthesis. The biochemical mechanisms relevant for cell proliferation have been reviewed and correlated to the present results.",

    "input": "Murine erythroleukemia cells are induced to differentiate by 0.5-5 ng of actinomycin D per ml. Murine erythroleukemia cells cultured with actinomycin D prolong cell doubling time but achieve the same density after 5 days as cells without inducer. Actinomycin D causes over 95% of the cells to become benzidine-reactive. [(3)H]Actinomycin D uptake into DNA can be detected within 2 hr and reaches a maximum (approximately 0.1 pmol/10(6) cells) by 10-12 hr. It is estimated that about one out of 10(5) dG.dC pairs is bound to actinomycin D. Commitment to differentiation, assayed by transfer of cells to culture without inducer, was detected as early as 5 hr. Unlike Me(2)SO, which causes a transient prolongation in G(1) at about 15-20 hr, cells cultured with actinomycin D show a more sustained increase in the proportion of the cells in G(1). Globin mRNA accumulation was detectable by 19 hr in culture. Alteration in DNA stability in alkaline sucrose gradients was detected by 19 hr. Actinomycin D induces synthesis of Hb(maj) and Hb(min) in approximately equal amounts. A decrease in rates of synthesis of RNA, DNA, and total protein occurs in cells cultured with actinomycin D, as well as in cells cultured with Me(2)SO. No evidence for an early action of actinomycin D at the plasma membrane was obtained by measurement of changes in cell volume or (86)RbCl uptake. Taken together, the present results indicate that actinomycin D is a potent inducer of differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells and suggest that the target of its effect may be at the level of DNA.",

The increased rate of thymidine incorporation into DNA, induced by these two agents, was measured in the presence and in the absence of three inhibitory conditions (cycloheximide or dibutyryladenosine 3':5'-monophosphate added to the medium, or lack of anchorage). The inhibition was found to be quite similar in cultures stimulated by virus or serum; under the same conditions, however, the incorporation into mitochondrial DNA was much less inhibited than that into nuclear DNA. The experiments also suggest that new protein synthesis may not be necessary, for either virus or serum, to start the inductive mechanism.",

By a stathmokinetic method, by micro-flow fluorometry and by autoradiography certain kinetic parameters were measured during 10 days after the last injection. Cell counts were made and the turnover time of the differentiating cells estimated. Protein synthesis was estimated by the uptake of radioactive histidine, and dry cell mass measured by weighing. Bleomycin affected cell proliferation in the epidermis by depressing biphasically both the number of cells in, and the passage of cells through, the cell cycle phases: S, G2 and M, most probably by directly affecting late G1 cells and cells in mitosis. The time between the two minima of depressed DNA synthesis corresponded to the mean generation time of the basal cells. Histidine uptake and dry cell mass were slightly affected, but the turnover time of the differentiating cells was prolonged. Bleomycin thus had a strong long-lasting inhibitory effect on epidermal cell proliferation and a marked inhibitory effect on epidermal cell maturation in mice.",
    "output": "The method used to estimate protein synthesis in the hairless mice given Bleomycin was by measuring the uptake of radioactive histidine. This method is a form of autoradiography, where the incorporation of a radioactive label into a molecule (in this case, histidine) indicates its synthesis. The higher the uptake of radioactive histidine, the higher the rate of protein synthesis. In the context provided, it's not clear whether other methods, such as micro-flow fluorometry, were also used to confirm or complement the results obtained from the radioactive histidine uptake method."

    "input": "A number of metabolic inhibitors and chemotherapeutic agents have been found to increase the sensitivity of a chemically induced guinea pig hepatoma (line 1) to killing by antibody and complement. We have investigated whether the mechanism whereby these drugs increase sensitivity to killing is attributable to their primary action of inhibiting DNA, RNA, or protein synthesis. Line 1 cells incubated for 1, 4, or 17 hr with actinomycin D (25 microng/ml), adriamycin (40 microng/ml), or puromycin (5 micron/ml) or with 5-fold lower concentrations of these drugs were maximally inhibited (greater than 90%) in their ability to synthesize DNA, RNA, and protein within 1 hr. However, only cells incubated for 17 hr with the high concentrations of drugs showed increased sensitivity to killing by antibody and complement. Line 1 cells incubated with high concentrations of these drugs of 17 hr, washed, and resuspended in drug-free medium recovered their resistance to killing by antibody and complement within 4 hr. These cells ever after culture for 24 hr in drug-free medium did not regain their ability to synthesize DNA, RNA, or protein. A similar lack of correlation between synthesis of these macromolecules and sensitivity to antibody-complement-mediated killing was observed after the cells were treated with physical agents that inhibit macromolecular synthesis. Both heat-treated and X-irradiated cells were inhibited in their ability to synthesize DNA, RNA, and protein immediately after treatment; however, only X-irradiated cells (6 and 16 hr postirradiation) were increased in their sensitivity to antibody-complement-mediated killing. Our data show that the ability of line 1 tumor cells to resist humoral immune attack does not depend solely on their ability to synthesize DNA, RNA, or protein.",

However, it's important to note that this sensitivity was only temporary, as cells recovered their resistance to killing within 4 hours after being washed and resuspended in drug-free medium.

Patients were allocated at random to receive either 100 mg ketoprofen twice daily or 400 mg ibuprofen 3-times daily over a period of 3 months. Subjective overall assessments of symptoms, based on rating scale scores for pain, duration of morning stiffness and inflammation, showed that there was a greater, more rapid and more sustained improvement in those patients treated with ketoprofen. Measurements of inflamed joint size and of grip strength also improved more with ketoprofen than with ibuprofen. Side-effects, notably nausea, epigastric discomfort and abdominal pain, were more frequent and severe with ketoprofen, leading to the withdrawal of 2 patients in the early stage of the trial, and were probably related to the high dosage used.

Uropepsinogen excretion, occult blood in faeces and standard physiological parameters were also monitored. Protacine globally decreased symptom scores by 58.5% and indomethacin by 24.3% (p less than 0.001). The computed time to reduce symptom scores by 50% was 17.2 days with protacine as compared to 39.2 days with indomethacin (p less than 0.001). Physiological parameters did not change, except white blood cells which decreased after protacine (each subject however, remaining well within the physiological range) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which decreased in both groups. Uropepsinogen excretion increased by 70% after protacine, and threefold after indomethacin (p less than 0.001). Occult blood search was positive in 1 patient receiving protacine, while 2 who were already positive before receiving protacine became negative during the treatment. Four patients taking indomethacin were found to be positive, 1 showing melaena. The one who was already positive before treatment showed increasing severity of occult bleeding during indomethacin administration.

Below a pH of 7.2 metabolic acidosis at normal arterial CO2-tensions caused an increase of coronary blood flow and a decrease of coronary vascular resistance associated with a narrowed myocardial arteriovenous O2-difference, indicating vasodilation at unchanged myocardial oxygen consumption. In propranolol-pretreated dogs myocardial blood flow and coronary oxygen AV difference remained unaffected, suggesting that the coronary dilatory effect of metabolic acidemia involves beta adrenergic stimulation. Coronary vasodilation induced by increasing arterial pCO2 was found to the significantly greater as compared with the dilatory effect of metabolic acidosis at the same blood pH level. Blocking of beta receptors did not reduce the coronary response to increased arterial CO2-tensions. It is concluded that the coronary vasodilation observed during hypercapnic acidosis is neither mediated by a beta adrenergic stimulation nor dependent of the concomitant change in blood pH. The possible sites of the coronary dilatory actions of increased arterial CO2-tensions are discussed.",

A lower PaO2 value may suggest inadequate oxygenation, while a higher value suggests adequate oxygenation. However, it's important to note that the PaO2 value should be interpreted in conjunction with other blood gas measurements, such as the oxygen saturation (SaO2), to fully understand the oxygenation status of the individual."

    "input": "Perfusion of the small intestine of anesthetized cats with a solution having excessive CO2 and H+ concentration (pCO2 60 mm Hg; pH; 7.2; [HCO3-] 25 MM) produced a threshold reflex increase in the blood pressure. The subsequent increase of pCO2 to 380 mm Hg and decrease of pH to 6.4 evoked a gradual raise of the blood pressure (8.0+/-0.6 mm Hg) followed by the sharp increase of pressor reflexes amplitude within the range of pH 6.4--6.1. Tissue receptors were found to be essentially sensitive to solutions imitating metabolic acidosis (decrease of [HCO3-] within the physiological range of pH changes (pH 7.1--6.8). Solutions with pH 6.4--6.1 imitating respiratory acidosis (increase of pCO2) were more effective than those imitating metabolic acidosis.

    "input": "Average Po2 and Pco2, local blood flow and pH values in the cerebral cortex of the cat were measured during passive hyperventilation (arterial Pco2 below 19 mm Hg). At defined intervals tissue samples were taken for metabolite analysis. The object of the study was to correlate the data obtained on the brain surface with metabolic responses. Immediately after the start of hyperventilation blood flow decreased, average cortical tissue pressures of O2 and CO2 fell, and there was a simultaneous rise in cortical pH. At a later stage in the experiment the local blood supply reverted to its resting level. Despite a fivefold rise in tissue lactate level during hyperventilation and a decrease in local O2 pressure on the brain surface to 5-10 mm Hg the degree of phosphorylation of energy rich phosphates was not less than under normal conditions of oxygenation. Our investigations showed no evidence of energy lack in cerebral cortex cells during hyperventilation. Cellular hypoxia and its characteristics are defined. The possible causes of raised tissue lactate levels during hyperventilation despite the lack of evidence of cellular hypoxia are discussed.",

Soon after recovery from short-lasting anesthesia, a total of 20 groups of six each were individually exposed to five different oxygen levels varying from 21.0 to 9.0% combined with four CO2 levels ranging from 0 to 12.9% at a mean barometric pressure of 744 Torr. Arterial blood samples were collected and analyzed for pH, Po2, and Pco2 before and near the end of 20-min exposures. During an air-breathing control period, pH averaged 7.466 plus or minus 0.020 SD, Paco2 41.2 plus or minus 1.9 Torr and Pao2 91.8 plus or minus 3.5 Torr. During hypoxia, Pao2 levels were similar to that of acutely hypoxic humans. Rats apparently differ from man in that blood buffering is greater, resulting in a higher pH during air breathing and a smaller [H-+] increase with increasing Paco2. Differences between arterial and inspired CO2 were about 10 Torr at 60 and 90 Torr Plco2 and were not influenced by Plo2.",

The pH change was found to have an apparent half time of 6.0 +/- 0.5 s at 38 degrees C, similar to that predicted by previous mathematical simulations on the basis of uncatalyzed CO2 hydration kinetics and the buffering characteristics of plasma. Measurements were also made in vivo in dogs by withdrawing blood rapidly from a carotid artery through a temperature-controlled chamber containing a pH electrode. When the flow was stopped, we measured the pH change which occurs in blood (after it leaves the lungs) as the slow dehydration of bicarbonate continues. The measured half time was 7.3 +/- 0.6 s, again agreeing well with predictions. Essentially the same half time was found when the direction of approach to chemical equilibrium was reversed by adding CO2 to the inspired air. The rate of the reactions could be increased markedly by hemolyzing the blood to release carbonic anhydrase into the plasma.",

The subsequent decrease of [HCO-3] to 3.2 mM and pH to 6.5 evoked a gradual raise of the blood pressure followed by a sharp increase of pressor reflexes amplitude within the range of pH 6.5--6.3. Solutions imitating metabolic acidosis (pH = 7.1; [HCO-3] = 12.7 mM) were found to increase the concentration of H+ ions in the outflow perfusate and blood pressure to larger extent than solutions imitating respiratory acidosis (pH = 7.1; PCO2 = 75 mm Hg). If the solution pH was held constantly at 7.4 by simultaneous decreasing PCO2 and [HCO-3] by a factor of two, a reflex increase in the blood pressure and decrease of perfusate pH had no effect either on blood pressure or perfusate pH.

    "input": "Changes in the total CO2 content of tissues were determined in order to characterize variations in intracellular acid-base parameters during the onset of hypercapnia. Within two minutes after an increasement in the CO2 tension of the inspired air of rats, there were large increases in the intracellular bicarbonate concentrations of both cardiac and skeletal muscles. Greater changes occurred in the heart, and its intracellular pH remained near normal during the first hour of hypercapnia; whereas there was an intracellular acidosis in skeletal muscle. This greater capacity of the heart to buffer excess CO2 has been linked to an increased movement of bicarbonate ions into and/or hydrogen ions out of cardiac cells during hypercapnia (Lai et al., 1973c). Yet, the buffer capacity of the heart was not compromised by metabolic acidosis during which there was a greatly reduced extracellular bicarbonate ion concentration and a greatly increased extracellular hydrogen ion concentration. The intracellular pH of the cardiac ventricle was stable following the imposition of a noncarbonic acid load on normocapnic rats.",
    "output": "The intracellular pH of the cardiac ventricle remained stable following the imposition of a noncarbonic acid load on normocapnic rats.

    "input": "To investigate the hypothesis that blood pH and PCO2 continue to change after the blood leaves an exchange capillary, we used a rapidly responding, pressure-insensitive, stopped-flow pH electrode apparatus. Arterial blood from an anesthetized dog or cat is drawn through the apparatus into a syringe. Syringe movement is then suddenly stopped. Temperature and pH of the blood in the electrode assembly are continuously monitored, both before and after blood withdrawal ceases. Hemolysis was reduced by coating all blood contact surfaces with silicone and fasting the animal overnight, anesthetizing it with crystalline pentobarbital sodium, and allowing it to ventilate spontaneously. After stopping withdrawal, pH of blood in the electrode chamber continued to change, rising 0.01 unit with t1/2 of 4.4 s. After lysed blood was returned to the animal to provide carbonic anhydrase to the plasma, no pH change was seen after stopping the flow. The small pH rise occurring in arterial blood in vivo is probably due in large part to disequilibrium of [H+] between red blood cells and plasma at the end of the pulmonary capillary, the equilibration process being rate-limited by the extracellular CO2 hydration-dehydration reaction.",

Comparison between continuous readings and results of single sample analyses showed practically no discrepancy, and the drifts of the electrodes during time of measurements were negligible. During hypothermic perfusion with a Rygg-Kyvsg\u00e5rd bubble oxygenator, autotransplantation of canine hearts was performed. PO2, PCO2 and pH were measured continuously to check the performance of the heart-lung machine, and to evaluate the therapeutic and diagnostic significance of these blood gas values during cardiac surgery. At the start of perfusion, a steep fall in all three parameters was observed. The average fall in PO2 was 313 mmHg; PCO2 fell by 15 mmHg and pH BY 0.15. PCO2 rapidly returned to normal values, while pH and PO2 increased slowly during the perfusion period. PO2 reached its highest value at the lowest temperature and fell during rewarming. PCO was regulated by the carbon dioxide concentration in the heart-lung machine. pH did not return to normal levels within the time of perfusion. In the transistional period from perfusion, PCO2 increased and pH fell. Alterations in the distribution and direction of blood flow and a low systemic blood pressure are possible explanations of the initial fall in PO2 and the post-perfusion changes in PCO2 and pH. The variations in pH and PCO2 at the start of perfusion were caused by an acid priming fluid with low CO2 content. The post-perfusion changes indicated an unstable circulation, but imminent myocardial failure could not alone be diagnosed by continuous measurement.",

His career in Austria was disrupted by political forces but, with energy and ability, he continued it with distinction in the United States. After retirement at age 70, he turned to social writings.

Reference is made to the reports of Tenon and Howard on hospitals in several European countries, which instead of considering the hospital as a mere architectural object make recommendations based on the numbers of beds of an institution, its usable space, the dimensions of wards, mortaility rates, etc.; the result is a new functional concept of the medical and physical organization of the hospital. The author delves into the characteristics of the hospital and medical practice in the Middle Ages, the 17th and 18th centuries, and since the middle of the 18th. He brings out the direct relationship of hospital organization to the economic regulations that emerged with mercantilism. He stresses the importance of man for social and military development on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to the application of a technology that could be described as political: the discipline. He is of the view that the introduction of disciplinary mechanisms in the confused environment of the hospital permitted its \"medicalization\" and the development of the medical-therapeutic hospital.",

Sprague-Dawley and Fischer 344 strain rats were given 3, 10, 20 or 40 mg gentamicin per kg body weight per day for 28 days. Morphologic alterations were evaluated by light and electron microscopy. Functional parameters included glomerular filtration rate, PAH secretion, renal plasma flow, sodium reabsorption, potassium excretion, urine volume and protein, and serum urea nitrogen. Oxidative metabolism of mitochondrial fractions from renal cortical homogenates was evaluated by oxygen uptake and P:O ratios. The results indicate focal proximal tubular injury, decreased tubular maximum secretion of PAH, and altered oxidative metabolism at the higher dose levels of gentamicin. Neither elevations of serum urea nitrogen nor alterations in glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, or sodium or potassium excretion were observed. Thus, it appears that high dose levels (40 mg per kg per day) alter the structure and function of some proximal tubular segments when administered over prolonged periods. The alterations appear reversible. Although nephro-toxicity is identified under these conditions in rats, extrapolation to human patients usually receiving much lower doses must be guarded.",

    "input": "Repeated injections of rat with 1-thyroxine (50 microgram/kg daily for 5 five-day weeks) retarded the weight gain of the animals and increased the absolute and relative size of the heart, adrenals and interscapular brown adipose tissue. In the myocardium and thigh muscle, thyroxine treatment resulted in elevated activity of oxidative enzymes, succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase, while the activities of glycolytic enzymes remained unchanged. Glycogen content of the heart was decreased following thyroxine regime. In the brown fat, on the other hand, thyroxine injections resulted in a reduction of the activity of oxidative enzymes. This reduction can be accounted for by the decreased protein (enzyme) content of the tissue due to deposition of fat. Furthermore, thyroxine treatment delayed the body cooling of the rats swimming in water at 25 degrees C and enhanced hyperthermic response to injected noradrenaline. All these changes, which were not observable in rats treated with daily alprenolol (20 mg/kg) injections, were as pronounced in rats injected with alprenolol together with thyroxine as in rats injected with thyroxine only. It is concluded that beta blockers do not antagonize the metabolic changes due to hyperthyroidism.",
    "output": "The thyroxine treatment on the rats resulted in a decrease in the glycogen content of the heart. This is due to the elevated activity of oxidative enzymes in the myocardium, which may lead to increased utilization of glucose for energy production, thereby reducing glycogen stores. Additionally, the increased size of the heart could also contribute to the depletion of glycogen."

    "instruction": "What percentage of cases may have multicentricity according to the context?",
    "input": "The literature on granular cell myoblastoma (Abrikossoff's tumor) is reviewed and 16 new cases are presented. The etiology of this tumor remains uncertain, although a neurogenic origin appears likely. Individual tumors are usually small, nodular, and nonulcerating. There appeared to be no predilection for either sex in our series, and most tumors occurred between the third and sixth decades of life. Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia is frequently associated with granular cell myoblastoma, and this combination must be distinguished from squamous cell carcinoma. Wide local excision, the treatment of choice, should be curative, although the incidence of multicentricity may exceed 15%. Thus, despite the usually benign nature of granular cell myoblastoma, its propensity for local invasion, multicentricity, and associated pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia should alert surgeons to its potential hazards, to the probability of recurrence if it is only marginally excised, and to the possible later development of similar lesions.",
    "output": "The context suggests that the incidence of multicentricity in granular cell myoblastoma may exceed 15%. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate from the specific series presented in the context, and the actual percentage may vary in different patient populations. Therefore, it's not possible to definitively state the exact percentage of cases that may have multicentricity."

These tumors were variously located in the extremities, head, chest wall, retroperitoneum, lung, spermatic cord, and lower abdomen. Surgical treatment included radical amputations, wide local excision, pulmonary lobectomy, and nephrectomy. Cobalt therapy and chemotherapy with vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and chlorambucil were also used.

The lesions could be resected but both patients developed early cerebral metastases. The neoplasms were predominantly fibroblastic, had a characteristic storiform pattern, and included large histiocytes with bizarre nuclei and a vacuolated cytoplasm. The ultrastructure of the cells in the fibroblastic areas was characterized by irregular nuclei and a cytoplasm with a well-developed endoplasmic reticulum and dilated cisternae. Some cells lacked the prominent endoplasmic reticulum of fibroblasts and others were characteristic histiocytes with numerous cytoplasmic lysosomes.

Thirty-five cases originating in various deep structures of the head and neck, excluding the orbit, have been reported in the literature since 1972. One additional case, a malignant tumor of the submandibular gland, is added herewith. Recurrence following initial surgery has been common and stems from inadequate excision of the primary lesion. Microscopic spread of this tumor from its primary site calls for radical rather than conservative surgical excision. At present, radiotherapy and chemotherapy appear to be of little value in the treatment of these tumors.",

The age range was from 11 to 69 years; the average age was 34 years. The tumor occurred most commonly in the distal femur and proximal tibia. The distinguishing histologic feature was a storiform arrangement of spindle cells. The differential diagnosis included fibrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, malignant giant cell tumor, malignant lymphoma, and metastatic carcinoma. Follow-up of at least three years was available in 21 cases. Of these, nine patients were alive and free of metastases three and one-half to 12 years after treatment. Two were alive with solitary metastases at three years, and 10 patients died between three months and three years after treatment. In four cases the lesions were multicentric at the time of diagnosis and in four cases were associated with bone infarction. This tumor must be recognized as an important complication of bone infarction and should be suspected when a patient with a known history of bone infarction develops a change in symptoms. Because the prognosis of this tumor is significantly better than that in those tumors with which it had been previously grouped, and in view of its association with bone infarction, it deserves to be maintained as a distinct clinicopathologic entity. Amputation is the treatment of choice.",

Grafts of various species were shown to be of significantly different biomechanical properties. This depended on basic substance, compound and texture of collagenous and elastic fibres and the methods of conservation. Preoperatively the transplants were sufficiently resistent against urine and bladder pressure. 3. Within of few weeks postoperatively there was an increase in bladder capacity. This was more evident and arose in an earlier period than in cases without bladder wall replacement (x-ray-control). 4. Autologous grafts were infiltrated by young new tissue. Homologous and heterologous patches served as \"guide\" of regeneration. Complete transitional cell epithelium was proven to be present after four weeks in the predominantly connective tissue regenerates.

These effects were more pronounced on intra-aortic than on intravenous administration of dopamine. 3 In about half of the animals studied, injection or infusion of dopamine elicited a decrease of vascular resistance in the innervated femoral artery, whereas systemic blood pressure either did not change or decreased. In the denervated femoral artery, an increase in vascular resistance was alway observed. 4 The decrease in femoral vascular resistance was considered to correspond with neurogenic vasodilation caused by paravertebral ganglionic inhibition since (i) it only occurred in the innervated hindleg, (ii) blood pressure did not rise, (iii) this decrease was insensitive to atropine or propranolol and (iv) it was blocked by small doses of haloperidol. When hypovolemic shock was produced, the incidence of the neurogenic decrease of vascular resistance was smaller. 5 Dopamine also increased renal blood flow. This increase was not reduced by the occurrence of the neurogenic vasodilation in the inervated femoral artery. 6 These results are consistent with the idea that the dopamine-induced neurogenic vasodilation, originally described in the isolated perfused hindleg of the dog, also occurs when the circulation to the hindleg is intact. This suggests that, in the dog, also occurs when the circulation to the hindleg is intact. This suggests that, in the dog. the inhibitory effect of dopamine on sympathetic ganglia modulates its peripheral vasoconstrictor effects. In hypovolemic shock, where sympathetic nervous activity is high, the inhibitory effect of dopamine on sympathetic ganglia disappears and its direct vasoconstrictor effect on the vessels dominates.",
    "output": "In the context provided, it is stated that when dopamine was injected or infused in anaesthetized dogs, it caused a decrease in vascular resistance in the innervated femoral artery. However, in the denervated femoral artery, an increase in vascular resistance was observed. This suggests that the dopamine-induced neurogenic vasodilation, which is the relaxation of the smooth muscles in the blood vessels, is dependent on the presence of the sympathetic nerves in the artery. When the artery is denervated, the direct vasoconstrictor effect of dopamine dominates, leading to an increase in vascular resistance."

    "instruction": "What was the effect of alpha adrenergic blockade on the response to epinephrine infusion in the right and left gastric arteries?",
    "input": "The effects of intra-arterial infusions of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and isoproterenol upon right and left gastric blood flow were studied in anesthetized dogs. Blood flow was measured electromagnetically before and after adrenergic blockade. Infusion of epinephrine (0.05 mug Kg.(-1) min.(-1)) resulted in vasoconstriction (-50 +/- 6 ml. min.(-1)) with autoregulatory escape in the right gastric artery (RGA) and constriction (-41 +/- 8 ml. min.(-1)) followed by significant dilation (+ 56 +/- 10 ml. min.(-1)) in the left gastric artery (LGA). Alpha adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine produced only a dilator response in both RGA and LGA to epinephrine infusion and beta adrenergic blockade resulted in a constrictor response with no autoregulatory escape. Norepinephrine infusions produced a constrictor response of similar magnitude as epinephrine but with little evidence of autoregulatory escape in either RGA and LGA. Alpha adrenergic blockade significantly attenuated this response in both circulations. Isoproterenol is a dilator in both circulations and its response is attenuated only by beta adrenergic blockade. This study demonstrates that the canine stomach has two regionally distinct circulations with the fundus and body exhibiting a greater dilator response than the antrum and pylorus.",
    "output": "In the context provided, it's clear that alpha adrenergic blockade had a significant effect on the response to epinephrine infusion in both the right and left gastric arteries. Specifically, alpha adrenergic blockade produced only a dilator response in both arteries to epinephrine infusion, whereas, without blockade, epinephrine initially caused vasoconstriction followed by significant dilation. This suggests that alpha adrenergic receptors play a role in the initial vasoconstriction response to epinephrine, but their blockade prevents this response and results in persistent dilation."

Chromosome analysis and DNA content studies at early passage revealed that the genetic complement for all clones was predominantly near tetraploid. All cultures examined contained a proportion of hypertetraploid cells. Nonrandom chromosome changes included at least one broken No 1 chromosone in 80% or more of the cells in each clone, and fewer sex chromosomes than anticipated from the ploidy of the cells. Several abnormal marker chromosomes tended to recur. These changes were more pronounced in the cells cultured from tumors formed by three of the clones. A karyotypically stable stem line was not noted for any of the clones or tumors. The functional significance of the karyotypic heterogeneity was assessed by means of cloning efficiencies both on plastic and in methylcellulose.",

Hamster or rabbits, appropriately immunized to the tumour cells, produced virus-neutralizing antibody. The serum titres were invariably low, suggesting that only small quantities of virion antigen were present in the cells. Hamster sensitized to HSV and resistant to virulent virus challenge did not reject low numbers of tumour cells, nor was the incidence of lung metastases significantly reduced. Virus-sensitized lymph-node cells, readily cytotoxic for HSV-infected hamster embryo fibroblasts, did not lyse any of three transformed lines tested in an 18-h 51chromium release test. Animals that had their tumour excised demonstrated no or only modest resistance to tumour rechallenge.

In contrast to wild-type SV40, ts A30, ts A 239 and ts BC210 were oncogenic in adult hamsters inducing tumors after almost the same latent period as wild type SV40 in newborns but in lower number of animals. Study of TSTA in some tumors (1 generation) induced in newborn and adult hamsters by wild type SV40 and its ts mutants (with the use of immunogenicity and immunosensitivity tests) revealed no significant difference among compared tumors: most of them were immunogenic and immunosensitive. In contrast hamster embryo cells in vitro transformed by SV40 ts A30, ts A239 and ts A209 mutants, studied at different passage levels were all immunoresistant during about 30 in vitro passages and in most cases 10--100 times less immunogenic than hamster embryo cells in vitro transformed by wild type SV40. At higher passage level in some of these lines expression of TSTA improved. The data obtained are discussed in connection with the recently demonstrated [5] significant quantitative difference in tumor specific transplantation antigen activity in hamster cells in vivo and vitro infected, or transformed by wild type SV40 and its ts A mutants.",

Cells transformed by the mutants were found to be 10-100 times less immunogenic than cells transformed by wild-type SV40. Additionally, these mutant-transformed cells were immunoresistant during about 30 in vitro passages. This suggests that the mutant strains of SV40 may have altered properties that affect their immunogenicity compared to the wild-type strain."

    "input": "Some of the properties of three continuous cell lines derived from BK virus-induced hamster tumors were examined. The cell lines had in vitro growth characteristics of transformed cells. Morphologically most of the cells were fibroblastic, but multinucleated giant cells were also common. Ultrastructurally all three cell lines displayed the usual features of cells grown in vitro. Marked variation in the nuclear size and shape as well as prominent nucleoli were characteristic to these cells. No viruses or virus-like particles were found. Virus isolation attempts by fusing the cells with Vero cells were negative, and no virion antigen was detected in these cells by immunofluorescence. T antigen similar to that of other papovaviruses was found in the cells. This antigen stained with sera from a number of hamsters carrying transplanted BK virus-induced tumors, and also with SV 40 T antisera. The antigen disappeared after 30 minutes at 56 degrees C. Cytogenetic analyses showed that the three cell lines were heteroploid with subtetraploid numbers of chromosomes. Chromosome abnormalities were also seen. All three cell lines induced sarcomatous tumors in adult hamsters after subcutaneous inoculation.",
    "output": "The T antigen in the BK virus-induced hamster tumor cells disappeared after being exposed to 56 degrees C for 30 minutes. This suggests that the T antigen is heat-labile in these specific cells. The T antigen is a common characteristic of papovaviruses and plays a crucial role in the viral replication process. Its disappearance might indicate denaturation or degradation at high temperatures. However, further studies would be required to confirm the exact mechanism of this phenomenon."

    "input": "Highly purified alpha-thrombin has been chemically modified in an attempt to determine which features of the molecule are important for normal platelet-thrombin interactions. Modifying agents included diisopropylphosphorofluoridate and 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-L-2-heptanone, which modify serine and histidine, respectively, at the catalytic site, as well as N-bromosuccinimide and 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide, which modify a single tryptophan at or near the fibrinogen-binding site. Active site-directed modification did not appreciably affect the binding characteristics, but prevented platelet activation. In contrast, modification of tryptophan at the macromolecular substrate-binding site resulted in the loss of high affinity binding of thrombin to platelets, while low affinity binding was apparently unaffected. This modification altered but did not abolish the ability of thrombin to effect platelet aggregation and release of [14C]serotonin. These results suggest that residues at the catalytic site are not involved in binding and that the macromolecular substrate-binding site of alpha-thrombin participates in high affinity binding to platelets. These data are also consistent with the existence of at least two types of binding sites for thrombin on the platelet surface as well as more than one platelet-binding region on the thrombin molecule.",

At 10(-6) M [3H]cytochalasin B, glucose of p-chloromercuribenzoate, an inhibitor of glucose transport inhibited binding by about 20%; treatment of membranes with 0.6 M KI which depolymerizes F actin to G actin caused about 60% inhibition of binding. These two types of inhibition were additive indicating two separate classes of binding sites, one associated with sugar transport and one with microfilaments. Filamentous structures with the diameter of microfilaments (50 A) were seen in electron micrographs of thin sections of the membranes. At concentrations greater than 10(-5) M [3H]cytochalasin B, binding was proportional to drug concentration, characteristic of non-specific adsorption or partitioning. Intracellular membranes of the hepatocyte also bound [3H]cytochalasin B, those of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum to a greater extent than plasma membranes. [3H]Colchicine bound to plasma membranes in proportion to the amount of membrane and at a rate compatible with binding to tubulin. However, other properties of the binding including effects of temperature, drug concentration and antisera against tubulin were different from those of binding to tubulin. Hence, no evidence was obtained for association of microtubular elements with these membranes. Despite this there appeared to be an interdependence between microtubule and microfilament inhibitors: vinblastine sulfate stimulated [3H]cytochalasin B binding and cytochalasin B stimulated 3H colchicine binding. [3H]Colchicine also bound to intracellular membranes, especially smooth microsomes.",

At a drug concentration of 10(-7) M in human plasma, dihydromorphine is bound to an extent of 14%, morphine to 23%, etorphine to 88% and fentanyl to 70%. These differences in binding are due to different degrees of hydrophobic interaction between the drugs investigated and the plasma or tissue components. The hydrophobic interactions are due to the unionized form of the drugs. The ionized form is bound to a negligible extent with all four compounds, possibly in part by ionic mechanism. Binding increased with increasing ionic strength of the protein solution, with raising temperature between 0 degrees C and 37 degrees C and with increasing pH values of the protein solution, features which are characteristic of hydrophobic interactions. Scatchard plots of the binding data, from which the total binding constants nk were derived, indicated high concentrations of binding sites compared with drug concentrations found analgesically effective in vivo.",

    "input": "alpha-Fetoprotein, a fetal protein associated with certain tumors, was found to bind bilirubin. Addition of human or bovine alpha-fetoprotein to bilirubin solutions enhanced the light absorbance of bilirubin and shifted its  maximum. Bovine alpha-fetoprotein caused a marked shift towards shorter wavelengths, while human alpha-fetoprotein gave a slight red shift. The spectral changes were used to study the characteristics of the binding of bilirubin by bovine alpha-fetoprotein. These studies indicated the presence of one binding site/molecule of alpha-fetoprotein with an association constant of about 1.1 . 10(6) M-1. A difference between the spectral changes brought about by alpha-fetoprotein and albumin allowed comparison of their relative affinities for bilirubin. The spectrum approximated the average between the spectra induced by the two proteins when the ratio of bovine alpha-fetoprotein to bovine albumin was 6.3 : 1, and of the human proteins 21 : 1, respectively. These results show that alpha-fetoprotein from two species binds bilirubin with an affinity somewhat lower than that of albumin. Binding of bilirubin by alpha-fetoprotein is in agreement with the recent demonstration of structural homology between alpha-fetoprotein and albumin. Whether alpha-fetoprotein plays a role in the metabolism of bilirubin or other degradation products of heme remains to be investigated.",

Attachment of mycoplasmas suspended in buffer increased with temperature, decreased with higher ionic strength, and showed a maximum at about pH 5.5. The findings suggest a participation of ionic bonds in the attachment process. Trypsin did not detach glass-bound mycoplasmas, and treatment of the cells with glutaraldehyde did not reduce their attachment to glass, suggesting that membrane components other than proteins may be involved in the attachment. Low concentrations (up to 20 mg/ml) of bovine serum albumin buffer. However, during the next few hours, attachment increased far above the bovine serum albumin control. This marked increase was reduced by more than half in the presence of chloramphenicol. Increased attachment was also observed when glucose (0.1 to 2 mg/ml) was added to the bovine serum albumin-containing buffer. The findings suggest different mechanisms for the attachment in protein-free buffer and in growth medium or glucose-containing bovine serum albumin buffer, respectively. The latter apparently requires metabolic activity of the mycoplasmas.",

Besides some low-affinity binding sites suramin has, on the bovine serum albumin molecule one and on the human serum albumin molecule two, high-affinity binding sites. Spectroscopic measurements reveal that there are large differences between the albumins in the mechanism of binding to the high-affinity binding sites. Further, it is suggested that high concentrations of suramin provoke an unfolding of the albumin moleculse. In order to explain the unusual behaviour of suramin in connection with the displacement of other ligands from the albumin binding the fluorescence probe 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) was employed as a reporter group molecule for fluorescence as well as circular dichroism measurements. By these measurements it could be shown that suramin greatly influences the microorganization of both albumin molecules. In the case of these measurements large differences between bovine and human serum albumin were also found.",

The macromolecules were found in the plasma of approximately 2 per cent of ambulatory adults and hospitalized children and 32 per cent of the patients at two institutions for the mentally retarded. The binding properties of these macromolecules were studied by incubating with peptides labeled with 125iodine, and separating bound from free labeled peptide using small gel filtration columns. The peptide-binding macromolecules from several patients were compared. They showed very similar specificity for a group of arginyl peptides of the des-aspartyl1-angiotensin sequence. The plasma binders differed from one another in their optimum pH and their mobility in electrophoretic fields. Those with more acid pH optima displayed more rapid electrophoretic mobility. The binders fell into two classes based on apparent molecular weight, approximately 140,000 and 250,000. Those with the higher apparent molecular weight contained a large proportion of binder that could be precipitated with antiserum to human IgA. Kinetic measurements showed that the plasma binders were somewhat heterogeneous with respect to affinity for (des-asp1)-angiotensin, with apparent association constants ranging from 10(7) to 10(8) M-1. Binding activity was labile to heat, and to treatment with pepsin or trypsin. It was inhibited by calcium, protamine, streptomycin, and some other cationic compounds. The plasma peptide binder differed in specificity and molecular weight from soluble angiotensin-binding molecules extracted from tissues, and from properties expected of a receptor for angiotensin. These macromolecules may be useful reagents for measuring (des-asp1)-angiotensins. Their presence in plasma samples may interfere with angiotensin assays in some circumstances.",

    "input": "Binding and proximity relationships of hydrophobic ligands on human serum albumin have been studied using absorption, fluorescence, circular dichroism, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The ligands studied were bilirubin, two conjugated linear polyene fatty acids, cis-parinaric acid and cis-eleostearic acid, and three nitroxide derivatives of stearic acid with doxyl groups at positions 5, 10, and 12, respectively. Binding of polyene fatty acids was monitored by absorption peak shifts, induced circular dichroism, enhancement of fluorescence, and energy transfer between albumin's single tryptophanyl residue and the polyene chromophore. Induced circular dichroism studies indicate excitonic ligand-ligand interaction between bound fatty acids. Fluorescence enhancement of cis-parinaric acid was analyzed using a stepwise multiple equilibrium model, and six binding constants in the range 10(8) to 10(6) M-1 were obtained, in agreement with previous measurements for other fatty acids. The temperature dependence of the equilibrium constants indicates that the binding enthalpy is nearly zero. Fluorescence energy transfer was similarly used to quantitate bilirubin binding to albumin. Energy transfer, nitroxide quenching of fluorescence, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to elucidate binding geometries which support and extend proposed structural models for albumin. It is suggested that the first two fatty acids bind side-by-side in an antiparallel fashion in domain III of human serum albumin.",

The binding of 4-phenylbutyric acid to HSA was studied, too. Binding data were presented as Scatchard plots. There are two types of binding sites of different affinity for ara-C both on HSA and BSA. The relatively small value of affinity constant indicates that the pharmacological properties of ara-C might not be influenced very strongly by the HSA interaction or by competitive binding of other drugs. Selective chemical modifications of HSA with diethylpyrocarbonate (DEP) or o-nitrophenylsulfenyl chloride (NPS-Cl) reduce significantly the affinity of the strong binding area. On the other hand, the attachment of poly-alpha-L-glutamyl or poly-DL-alanyl side-chains to BSA increase the number of the strong and secondary binding sites and also the affinity at the first group of sites. Experimental results suggest a correlation between the binding affinity and therapeutic efficacy of various cytotoxic drug-protein complexes.",

The effect of bicarbonate is to increase the Vmax. of the transport process without changing the apparent Km. 3. The intracellular pH was estimated from the distribution of the weak base methylamine and the weak acid 5,5'-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione (DMO) across the plasma membrane. 4. The addition of bicarbonate to a cell suspension caused the internal pH to become more acid. 5. The initial rate of serine, alanine and glycine transport was a linear function of the initial difference in pH across the membrane. 6. It is concluded that bicarbonate activates the transport of these amino acids primarily by increasing the pH difference across the plasma membrane. 7. It is suggested that the uptake of serine together with Na+ ions occurs in exchange for H+ ions, which are translocated outwards on the same carrier system. Some preliminary evidence consistent with this model is presented.",
    "output": "The effect of bicarbonate on the apparent Km of the transport process of serine and alanine into isolated hepatocytes is not changed, but rather it increases the Vmax. This increase is primarily due to bicarbonate activating the transport of these amino acids by increasing the pH difference across the plasma membrane. This increase in pH difference is achieved because the addition of bicarbonate to a cell suspension causes the internal pH to become more acid. The uptake of serine and alanine occurs in exchange for H+ ions, which are translocated outwards on the same carrier system. This suggests that the apparent Km remains constant, while the maximum rate of transport (Vmax) is increased due to the changes in pH gradient across the plasma membrane."

Ureidosuccinic acid uptake occurs with proline but with ammonium sulfate as nitrogen source it is inhibited. The V for transport is 20-25 mumol/ml cell water per min. The apparent Km is 3-10(-5) M. For the urep1 mutant (ureidosuccinic acid permease less) the internal concentration never exceeds the external one. In the permease plus strain ureidosuccinic acid can be concentrated up to 10 000 fold and the accumulated compound remains unchanged in the cells. Energy poisons such as dinitrophenol, carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyldrazone (CCCP) or NaN3 inhibit the uptake. No significant efflux of the accumulated compound occurs even in the presence of these drugs. The specificity of the permease is very strict, only amino acids carrying an alpha-N-carbamyl group are strongly competitive inhibitors. The high concentration capacity of the cells and lack of active exit of the accumulated compound support the hypothesis of a carrier mediated active transport system.",

The transport system has a high concentration capacity, and there is no significant efflux of the accumulated compound, supporting the hypothesis of a carrier-mediated active transport system.

The uptake of calcium exhibited an apparent Km of 80 microM and V of 16.6 nmol calcium uptake x min-1 x mg protein-1. A fortyfold concentration gradient for calcium ions was calculated for both the ATP-induced and the respiration-induced transport of calcium. Removal of coupling-factor-latent ATPase resulted in the complete loss of ATP-driven Ca2+ transport whereas the respiration-driven uptake was reduced by 40-50%. The uptake of calcium was inhibited by the proton conducting ionophores carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and Gramicidin-D. The accumulated calcium was freely exchangeable with external calcium and was rapidly released by the addition of inhibitors of energy transduction, proton-translocating uncouplers or the ionophore A23187. The uptake of the weak base, methylamine, upon the oxidation of respiratory-linked substrates or the hydrolysis of ATP showed the generation of a protein gradient (inside acidic) which was partially collapsed on the addition of calcium ions. These results suggest that a Ca2+/H+ antiport mechanism may be responsible for the transport of calcium.",

    "input": "Uptake of Pi into brush-border membrane vesicles isolated from rat small intestine was investigated by a rapid filtration technique. The following results were obtained. 1. At pH 7.4 in the presence of a NaCl gradient across the membrane (sodium concentration in the medium higher than sodium concentration in the vesicles), phosphate was taken up by a saturable transport system, which was competitively inhibited by arsenate. Phosphate entered the same osmotically reactive space as D-glucose, which indicates that transport into the vesicles rather than binding to the membranes was determined. 2. The amount of phosphate taken up initially was increased about fourfold by lowering the pH from 7.4 to 6.0.3. When Na+ was replaced by K+, Rb+ or Cs+, the initial rate of uptake decreased at pH 7.4 but was not altered at pH 6.0.4. Experiments with different anions (SCN-,Cl-, SO42-) and with ionophores (valinomycin, monactin) showed that at pH 7.4 phosphate transport in the presence of a Na+ gradient is almost independent of the electrical potential across the vesicle membrane, whereas at pH 6.0 phosphate transport involves the transfer of negative charge. It is concluded that intestinal brush-border membranes contain a Na+/phosphate co-transport system, which catalyses under physiological conditions an electroneutral entry of Pi and Na+ into the intestinal epithelial cell. In contrast with the kidney, probably univalent phosphate and one Na+ ion instead of bivalent phosphate and two Na+ ions are transported together.",
    "output": "At pH 7.4, the initial rate of phosphate uptake decreases when Na+ is replaced by K+, Rb+, or Cs+. However, this decrease does not occur when the pH is lowered to 6.0.

The effects of pH and of several passive anion transport inhibitors such as dinitrofluorobenzene, sodium salicylate, sodium benzoate and phenylbutazone suggest that urate and chloride are transported by different mechanisms. 3. Urate influx seems to depend on intracellular glycolysis. The results obtained on red blood cells after glycolysis inhibition agree with those obtained on ghosts where metabolism does not take place. 4. The large drop in urate influxes into erythrocytes in the presence of a glycolysis inhibitor and of a passive ion transport inhibitor seems to argue in favour of a dual urate transport mechanism, one for passive diffusion and the other connected with glycolysis. 5. The drop in the urate influx into ghosts in the absence of ATP suggests that the latter might intervene in urate transport by human red cell membranes.",
    "output": "In the absence of ATP, the urate influx into ghosts (red blood cell membranes devoid of intracellular contents) is significantly reduced.

    "input": "This review of urinary acidification is primarily based on studies in isolated epithelia such as the turtle bladder. Despite the lack of unambiguous proof, the wealth of indirect evidence suggests that the cause of bicarbonate absorption is H+ secretion into the lumen. The mechanisms that regulate H+ transport are discussed. The electrochemical gradient for protons across the membrane is found to be the most fundamental regulator not only of passive movement but also of active transport. CO2 and aldosterone stimulate H+ transport, the latter by a mechanism apparently separate from the effect of this hormone on sodium transport. Although carbonic anhydrase activity is important for optimal function of the H+ pump, the results with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors need to be interpreted with caution. The evidence for Na:H exchange is reviewed and found to be not very persuasive, The metabolic pathways that fuel H+ transport are found to be all the major energy-yielding reactions in the cell, but particular prominence is given to the new discovery of the role of the pentose shunt in energizing transport. Finally, I discuss the important role H+ transport in energy transduction in subcellular organelles.",

    "input": "Selectively permeable membrane vesicles isolated from Simian virus 40-transformed mouse fibroblasts catalyzed Na+ gradient-coupled active transport of several neutral amino acids dissociated from intracellular metabolism. Na+-stimulated alanine transport activity accompanied plasma membrane material during centrifugation in discontinuous dextran 110 gradients. Carrier-mediated transport into the vesicle was demonstrated. When Na+ was equilibrated across the membrane, countertransport stimulation of L-[3H]alanine uptake occurred in the presence of accumulated unlabeled L-alanine, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, or L-methionine. Competitive interactions among neutral amino acids, pH profiles, and apparent Km values for Na+ gradient-stimulated transport into vesicles were similar to those previously described for amino acid uptake in Ehrlich ascites cells, which suggests that the transport activity assayed in vesicles is a component of the corresponding cellular uptake process. Both the initial rate and quasi-steady state of uptake were stimulated as a function of a Na+ gradient (external Na+ greater than internal Na+) applied artificially across the membrane and were independent of endogenous (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity. Stimulation by Na+ was decreased when the Na+ gradient was dissipated by monensin, gramicidin D or Na+ preincubation. Na+ decreased the apparent Km for alanine, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, and glutamine transport. Na+ gradient-stimulated amino acid transport was electrogenic, stimulated by conditions expected to generate an interior-negative membrane potential, such as the presence of the permeant anions NO3- and SCN-. Na+-stimulated L-alanine transport was also stimulated by an electrogenic potassium diffusion potential (K+ internal greater than K+ external) catalyzed by valinomycin; this stimulation was blocked by nigericin. These observations provide support for a mechanism of active neutral amino acid transport via the \"A system\" of the plasma membrane in which both a Na+ gradient and membrane potential contribute to the total driving force.",
    "output": "The presence of the permeant anions NO3- and SCN- had a stimulating effect on Na+ gradient-stimulated amino acid transport. This effect is indicative of the electrogenic nature of the amino acid transport process, as these anions contribute to the generation of an interior-negative membrane potential, which in turn enhances the transport activity."

    "input": "Membrane vesicles were prepared by osmotic lysis of spheroplasts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain P14, and the active transport of amino acids was studied. D-Glucose, gluconate, and L-malate supported active transport of various L-amino acids. The respiration-dependent leucine transport was markedly stimulated by Na+. Moreover, without any respiratory substrate, leucine was also transported transiently by the addition of Na+ alone. This transient uptake of leucine was not inhibited either by carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethyoxyphenylhydrazone or by valinomycin, but was completely abolished by gramicidin D. Increase in the concentration of Na+ of the medium resulted in a decrease of the Km for L-leucine transport, whereas the Vmax was not significnatly affected. Active transport of leucine was inhibited competitively by isoleucine or by valine, whose transport was also stimulated by Na+. On the other hand, Na+ was not required for the uptake of other L-amino acids tested, but rather was inhibitory for some of them. These results show (i) that a common transport system for branched-chain amino acids exists in membrane vesicles, (ii) that the system requires Na+ for its activity, and (iii) that an Na+ gradient can drive the system.",
    "output": "The increase in the concentration of Na+ in the medium had a significant effect on the Km for L-leucine transport, causing a decrease in the Km value. This means that a lower concentration of L-leucine is needed for half-maximal transport activity when Na+ concentration is increased. However, the Vmax was not significantly affected by the increase in Na+ concentration. This suggests that while the affinity of the transport system for L-leucine has changed, the maximum transport rate remains unchanged."

In the case of calcium the electrochemical potential difference (delta + zF-CIdeltaphi/RT) was the criterion employed. The rate of isotonic Na+-absorption (JNa) was measured with the shrinking droplet method. The effect of ouabain on the transport of these substances was tested in the golden hamster and the effect of SITS (4-acetamido-4'isothiocyanatostilbene 2,2'-disulfonic acid) was observed in rats. Ouabain (1 mM) applied peritubularly incompletely inhibited JNa (80%), but in combination with acetazolamide (0.2 mM) the inhibition was almost complete (93%). In addition, ouabain inhibited the sodium coupled (secondary active) transport processes of L-histidine, alpha-methyl-D-glycoside, calcium and phosphate by more than 75%. It did not affect H+ (glycodiazine) transport and PAH transport was only slightly affected. When SITS (1 mM) was applied from both sides of the cell it inhibited H+ (glycodiazine) transport by 72% and reduced JNa by 38% when given from only the peritubular cell side. SITS (1 MM), however, had no significant affect on H+ secretion and sodium reabsorption if it was applied from only the luminal side. Furthermore it had no affect on the other transport processes tested, regardless of the cell side to which it was applied. When the HCO-3 buffer or physically related buffers were omitted from the perfusate the absorption of Na+ was reduced by 66%, phosphate by 44%, and L-histidine by 15%. All the other transport processes tested were not significantly affected. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the active transport processes of histidine, alpha-methyl-D-glycoside and phosphate, which are located in the brush border, are driven by a sodium gradient which is abolished by ouabain. This may also apply to the Na+-Ca2+ countertransport located at the contraluminal cell side. The residual Na+ transport remaining in the presence of ouabain is likely to be passively driven by the continuing H+ transport which probably is driven directly by ATP. SITS seems to inhibit the exit step of HCO-3 from the cell and secondary to that, the luminal H+-Na+ exchange and consequently the Na+ reabsorption. In the absence of HCO-3 buffer in the perfusates the luminal H+-Na+ exchange seems to be affected and the pattern of inhibition of the other transport processes is almost the same as with SITS. The different effects on Pi reabsorption observed under these conditions might be explained by possible variations in intracellular pH.",

In the introduction of their paper they reviewed findings reported in the literature on placental causes and briefly also data on the sequelae of foetal hypotrophy for the foetus. Bioptic examination of the placenta can help to differentiate between foetal hypotrophy and immaturity. In foetal hypotrophy of placental origin it is important to differentiate between a primarily hypoplastic placenta (associated sometimes with congenital malformations of the foetus) and secondary insufficient placentas due to impaired uteroplacental circulation or other causes. In some instances both basic disorders may combine.",

    "instruction": "What percentage of pregnancies are complicated by essential hypertension?",
    "input": "Approximately 1% of pregnancies are complicated by essential hypertension. During pregnancy the blood pressure often stabilizes or improves. In patients with sustained hypertension, prospective controlled studies have demonstrated enhanced fetal survival when the blood pressure was controlled with antihypertensive medication. Such medication must be chosen carefully to avoid fetal and mateerial toxicity, and diuretics and salt restriction during pregnancy should be avoided. Among patients with essential hypertension the problem accelerates late in pregnancy in 2% to 11%; the acceleration may be predicted by determination of maternal mean arterial pressures and intravascular volumes early in pregnancy. The treatment of accelerated hypertension is identical to that of severe pre-eclampsia. Fetal loss is considerable but can be lessened by careful fetal and maternal monitoring and early controlled delivery. The risks of pregnancy in most patients with essential hypertension are small, and essential hypertension is not a uniform contraindication to pregnancy.",

One-minute Apgar score was less than 7 in 10.9% of the macrosomic infants, in contrast to 6.3% for the smaller infants studied as controls. The low fetal mortality rate (1.8%) was attributed to a 22.5% cesarean rate for the macrosomia group.

    "instruction": "What percentage of postterm pregnancies is observed to have fetal distress?",
    "input": "As pregnancy extends post term, incidence of placental insufficiency, fetal postmaturity (dysmaturity), and fetal perinatal death increases rapidly as a consequence of reduced respiratory and nutritive placental function. Despite a compensatory fetoplacental respiratory reserve capacity, fetal distress is observed in about one third of postterm pregnancies. On a biochemical level, placental pathophysiology in postterm-postmaturity pregnancies is not well understood. Postmaturity is correlated with increased incidence of placental lesions, fetal hypoxia-asphyxia, intrauterine growth retardation, increased perinatal death, and neonatal morbidity. Early diagnosis of fetal postmaturity is difficult because currently applied test methods allow recognition only when placental insufficiency is far progressed. Therefore, in postterm gravidas with a favorable cervix, induction of labor should be considered; in older primigravidas, in whom fetal losses may be sevenfold increased, or in multiparas with a history of obstetric complications, pregnancy may require termination by cesarean section. Pregnancy may be allowed to continue under close supervision in cases of uncertainty of duration of gestation, in gravidas carrying small babies, in young primigravidas, and in multigravidas in whom placentofetal function tests are normal. As long as fetal scalp blood sampling during labor does not show fetal acidosis, despite abnormal fetal heart rate pattern and meconium release, vaginal delivery may be attempted when deemed possible within a few hours. In parturients attention must be paid to the extent of uterine activity and type of medication; lateral positioning of the gravida and maternal oxygen breathing, facilitating fetal oxygen supply, are important features. Because during bearing-down efforts placentofetal respiratory reserves of postterm gravidas may become further compromised, immediate delivery by forceps or vacuum extraction may be considered. After delivery the umbilical cord should not be clamped immediately in order to allow increased fetal blood supply and to counteract fetal hypovolemia. Dysmature newborn infants require special care by the neonatologist.",
    "output": "Approximately one third (1/3) of postterm pregnancies are observed to have fetal distress. This is due to increased incidence of placental insufficiency, fetal postmaturity, and fetal perinatal death in postterm pregnancies. Early diagnosis of fetal postmaturity is difficult, and induction of labor should be considered in postterm gravidas with a favorable cervix, while termination by cesarean section may be necessary in certain cases. Close supervision and special care by the neonatologist are required for dysmature newborn infants."

    "input": "Hypertension during pregnancy and its complications are the most important cause of maternal and foetal death and morbidity. The chronic primary hypertension can be differentiated from the dysgravidia by anamnestic, biological, clinical and technical investigations. However the diagnosis remains difficult and the renal needle biopsy can help to ascertain it. The pathogenesis of dysgravidia is still obscure: the placental ischemia leads to a slow disseminated intravascular coagulation state with renal injury, while a vascular hyperreactivity leads to an increase of the resistance, a relative hypovolemia and lowering of cardiac output. The treatment and remote prognosis of the hypertensive disease associated with the pregnancy are summarized. The antihypertensive drugs improve the maternal prognosis while jeopardize the foetal outcome.",
    "output": "Antihypertensive drugs play a significant role in managing hypertension during pregnancy, which is a leading cause of maternal and fetal complications. These drugs help improve the maternal prognosis by controlling high blood pressure, preventing complications such as pre-eclampsia, and reducing the risk of stroke or other cardiovascular events.\n\nHowever, the use of these drugs can potentially jeopardize the fetal outcome. By lowering blood pressure, they may reduce the blood flow to the placenta, which could lead to fetal growth restriction or other complications. Therefore, the management of hypertension during pregnancy requires careful monitoring of both the mother and the fetus to ensure the best possible outcomes for both."

The stimulation was applied via surface electrodes to areas both segmentally related and segmentally unrelated to the regions of chronic pain. Low frequency stimulation induced a partial pain relief in only one patient whereas stimulation with high frequency gave a suppression of pain in seven patients. The effect was short-lasting in most cases and the pain started to increase usually within 30 min.

Statistical analysis of the two methods showed no significant difference. Not only did they appear to have the same therapeutic merit, but it would also seem reasonable to suppose that they have a common mechanism at their origin.

(2) A proportion of patients with chronic disease have their suffering made worse if they feel deprived of the latest therapy and may be relieved if they are given it in the right circumstances. In this group the relief will usually be temporary and the limited supply of such reactors will promote the cycle of fashion. In a group of 126 patients with chronic pain associated with organic disease who were offered transcutaneous stimulation, only 23 (18%) continued to use it one year after they started. (3) The cycling of therapeutic fashion is assisted not only because relief is often temporary, but also by the difficulty in establishing the normal range of variability from which significant change can be assessed and by the uncertain relationship between signs and symptoms and for the functions of daily living. For these reasons there is an inevitable tendency to temporary over-optimism and it seems impossible to counter this by the execution of a satisfactory clinical trial, since the patient cannot be \"blind\" and a significant variable is the enthusiasm with which a therapy is surrounded. (4) Electrical stimulation by cutaneous devices or implants can give much benefit to some patients in whom other methods have failed and there are indications, not only from anecdote and clinical impression but also now from experimental physiology, that it may benefit by mechanisms of interaction at the first sensory synapse.

These results show that ageing of connective tissue is more a dynamic process (with measurable metabolic parameters of the several connective tissue cells and their products) than a passive or so-called degenerative connective tissue process. The bradytrophy concept of connective tissue cannot be accepted any longer. Then connective tissue cells can produce metabolic rates of the same level like parenchymal cells. The different organs possess partly common basic processes partly differences in connective tissue ageing, dependent on the composition and patterns of proteoglycans resp. of GAG and collagen types, furthermore dependent on localisation, structure and function. The results on ageing of connective tissue are useful for better understanding of ageing processes of parenchymal organs. Then their ageing is influenced essentially by the ageing of the own connective tissues. The turnover, more than the number of mesenchymal and parenchymal cells, decreases with ageing. More old than young cells seem to exist in old tissues and organs. The performance of ageing connective tissue cells can be constant or increase or decrease. Many mesenchymal and parenchymal organs develop a so-called \"ageing-fibrosis\".",

The metabolic rates of these cells can be comparable to those of parenchymal cells. The turnover rate, rather than the number of cells, decreases with ageing. This means that there are more old cells present in older tissues and organs. The performance of ageing connective tissue cells can either remain constant, increase, or decrease. Additionally, many mesenchymal and parenchymal organs develop an \"ageing-fibrosis,\" which might be influenced by the ageing of their own connective tissues.

Tissues and cells examined have included liver, brain, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, prostate, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes. Receptors for steroids as well as membrane-active hormones such as insulin, glucagon, catecholamines, and prolactin were studied. Rats, mice, dogs, and humans have been employed. Changes in hormone receptor levels appear to constitute a common manifestation of the aging process, and offer interesting model systems in which to study the control of genetic expression during senescence.",
    "output": "In the context provided, it appears that various types of hormones had their receptors studied in relation to the aging process. These hormones include steroids, insulin, glucagon, catecholamines, and prolactin. Additionally, the aging process seems to involve a decrease in the concentrations of these hormone receptors in various tissues and cells such as liver, brain, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, prostate, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes. However, the binding affinities of these hormones do not seem to change with age. The studies were conducted using animals like rats, mice, and dogs, as well as humans. These findings suggest that changes in hormone receptor levels could be a common manifestation of the aging process, offering potential model systems to study genetic expression during senescence."

    "input": "The complex of membranes of which cells are comprised have been considered as likely sites of deterioration underlying the decline on physiologic competence with age.  Although this concept is an attractive one on theoreical grounds, few direct experimental data are available on the effect of age on biological membranes.  Since the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle has been well characterized and is an easily studied membrane system in regard both to its composition and function, the effect of age on this membrane system was explored.  Rats of 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 28 months of age were the source of sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes which were characterized by the following measurements: phospholipid/protein weight ratio; phospholipid composition; the activity of the (Ca++ + Mg++) -ATPase and the steady state concentration of its phosphorylated intermediate; the ATP-dependent, oxalatepromoted Ca++ transport activity.  Although there were some differences between age groups in these basic parameters of sarcoplasmic reticulum composition and function, the data obtained provide no clear evidence of deterioration of these membranes with age.",
    "output": "The measurements used to characterize the sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes in rats of different age groups included:\n\n1. Phospholipid/protein weight ratio: This measurement provides an indication of the relative amounts of phospholipids and proteins in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes.\n\n2. Phospholipid composition: This involves determining the types and proportions of different phospholipids present in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes.\n\n3. The activity of the (Ca++ + Mg++)-ATPase: This enzyme is crucial for the regulation of calcium ions in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The activity of this enzyme was measured to assess the functioning of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\n\n4. The steady state concentration of its phosphorylated intermediate: This measurement provides information about the state of the ATPase enzyme and its activity.\n\n5. The ATP-dependent, oxalate-promoted Ca++ transport activity: This measurement assesses the ability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum to transport calcium ions, which is a key function of this membrane system.\n\nThese measurements were used to characterize and compare the composition and function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes in rats of different age groups."

    "instruction": "What happens to parenchymal cells in all organs as part of the ageing process?",
    "input": "Ageing develops during the whole life with differences on cells, tissues and organs, and begins if their capacities for adaptations and compensations decrease. Theories about ageing are insufficiently. That results from the further development of ageing research in morphology also. Parenchymal cells are reduced in all organs, in favour of an enhanced connective tissue content, the function of the single parenchymal and mesenchymal cell is not diminished coincidently in ageing. In the most organs are young and old cells in every age stage (but more old cells in senile age). The most cells don't live endless, but they can be regenerated. Their organelles possess own biological half life times, which are very shorter than their cell life times. Ageing-typical increase of the total content of connective tissue, esp. of collagen in many organs is combined with alterations of the proteoglycan and collagen metaoblism rates and patterns (collagen types included), and are thereby connected with age dependent changes of the several functions of the cells, tissues and organs. Everybody, and esp. the physician has to know that the mean age of the population (and of the patients) becomes higher. So we need the morphological research in gerontology also, as demonstrated and summarized in this review.",
    "output": "In the ageing process, parenchymal cells in all organs undergo a reduction in number, with an increased connective tissue content taking its place. This change is not simultaneous with a diminished function of the parenchymal cells. The ageing process also involves an increase in the total content of connective tissue, especially collagen, in many organs. This increase is associated with alterations in the proteoglycan and collagen metabolism rates and patterns, leading to age-dependent changes in the functions of cells, tissues, and organs. However, it's important to note that while cells do not live indefinitely, they can be regenerated. The organelles within these cells have their own biological half-life times, which are shorter than the cell life times."

The surface lipids in the panel treated with oral tetracycline showed a small but not statistically significant decrease in free fatty acid content, but the subjects receiving topical tetracycline showed no reduction in free fatty acids. Further, neither treatment was associated with a change in mass of surface lipid nor did the mass or weight percent of any component of the surface lipids change with the decrease in acne severity.

Levels of CMV-specific antibody rose early in the illness, but the proliferative response of mononuclear cells to CMV antigen did not reach the level characteristic of CMV-immune donors until several months later. The production of interferon by mononuclear cells in response to CMV antigen was also low early in the illness. Although these patients had prior immunity to herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus, their mononuclear cells responded poorly to antigens prepared from these viruses. The proliferative response to these antigens returned to normal in parallel with the development of a normal response to CMV. It is suggested that acute CMV mononucleosis suppresses the proliferative response of human mononuclear cells.",
    "output": "The proliferative response of mononuclear cells to CMV antigen in patients early in their illness was not at the level characteristic of CMV-immune donors. This means that the cells were not responding as strongly to the CMV antigen as they would in individuals who have previously been exposed to and developed immunity against CMV.

    "input": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is closely associated with host cellular structures, and this has a significant impact upon the immunologic response following infection. CMV may be recovered from a variety of body secretions and fluids during acute infection, and protracted shedding may supervene in some instances. The reasons for a variable host response to CMV infection remain unclear, and the mechanisms responsible for the establishment of persistence have not been worked out. CMV persistence and latency are discussed, and some recently derived relevant data are presented. An animal model has been developed consistent with clinical observations pertaining to CMV transmission with blood. Results obtained in the course of these and other studies support the concept of immunological activation of latent CMV. The timing of CMV infection relative to an unrelated antigenic challenge is probably critical in determining the emergence of immunodepression or enhancement. Some aspects of CMV sero-diagnosis are also reviewed.",
    "output": "The timing of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection relative to an unrelated antigenic challenge is significant as it may influence the emergence of immunodepression or enhancement. This is because the immunologic response following CMV infection can vary, and the mechanisms responsible for the establishment of persistence are not fully understood. The timing could play a crucial role in determining how the host's immune system responds to the CMV infection and a subsequent unrelated antigenic challenge. This could potentially impact the severity of the disease or the effectiveness of the immune response. The exact details of this interaction are not fully worked out, but studies suggest that immunological activation of latent CMV may be critical in this context."

Six viruric children responded poorly in both assays. Two older nonviruric children responded in the blastogenesis assay, and lymphocytes from one of them produced interferon. Mothers of older children usually responded in the blastogenesis assay, but only one of them produced interferon. Mothers whose infected infants were younger than nine months of age responded poorly in both assays, while control seropositive postpartum women generally responded normally. The cell-mediated immune defects detected in this study may play a role in the pathogenesis of congenital CMV infection.",
    "output": "In the context provided, it is stated that mothers of older children typically responded in the lymphocyte blastogenesis assay. However, it's important to note that not all mothers produced interferon in this assay. The mothers of older children who did not produce interferon in the assay still responded, but only in the lymphocyte blastogenesis assay. This suggests that their cell-mediated immunity to cytomegalovirus (CMV) might be present but not fully functional, as shown by the lack of interferon production."

The prospective study covered the time from early pregnancy to 1 year post partum. The frequency of intrauterine infections was 2%, while 30% of the children became perinatally infected as indicated by the onset of virus excretion and an antibody response at the age of 2--4 months. Later on the occurrence of CMV infections declined sharply. 23 mothers had no CMV antibodies and none of their children contracted CMV during the first year of life. Maternal antibodies seemed unable to protect the child from CMV infections or to delay the onset of virus excretion in perinatally infected children. Intrauterine infections did not correlate with significant increases in the antibodiy titres of the mothers or the presence of IgM antibodies either in the mother's sera or in the cord sera. Perinatal infections were often associated with the presence of IgM antibodies both in the child and in the mother and in these mothers significant increases in CMV antibody titres were frequently seen, probably indicating an activated latent infection.

Virus was not detected in washed erythrocytes, plasma, or leukocyte lysates. Mononuclear leukocytes from patients with acute CMV mononucleosis displayed an elevated level of incorporation of [3H]thymidine on the day of donation compared with that in cells from convalescent patients or normal donors. Responses to pokeweed mitogen and concanavalin A were significantly lower in patients with CMV mononucleosis than in normal donors. There were no significant differences among the acute, convalescent, and normal donor groups in response to phytohemagglutinin or in the one-way mixed leukocyte reaction. These findings suggest that in patients with CMV mononucleosis virus infects and may persist within peripheral blood leukocytes and that the lymphocytes of these patients are selectively hyporesponsive to certain mitogens.",

Under these conditions, CMV specific antigens were undetectable. Infection of lymphoblastoid cells with CMV resulted in atypical virus growth curves similar to those obtained with persistently infected human embryonic kidney cells. Although some variation existed in the relative sensitivity of lymphoblasts, cells of B (Raji, P3J-HR-1, RPMI 8226) and T (CCRF-CEM) origin were susceptible to infection with CMV. Variation in the sensitivity of lymphoblasts to CMV infection did not correlate with differences in virus adsorption or the presence of Epstein-Barr virus deoxyribonucleic acid.

Productive infection in the younger children at the time of assay and the presence of disease correlated strongly with the absence of responses. The mothers as a group also demonstrated impaired CMI to CMV while reacting normally to HSV-1 antigen. Neither time after transmission of infection nor viral excretion was significantly associated with impaired CMI, although a trend toward diminished responses was evident among women who were shedding virus.

    "input": "The case is described of a 44-year-old man with acquired cutis laxa. The primary clinical manifestation was an erythema of the chest. Gradually there developed persistent circumscribed lesions in other areas of the skin, spreading into large erythematous plaques with loose skin. Slight restrictive ventilatory insufficiency, elongation of the vocal cord and diverticulosis of the colon were also found, indicating a chronic and widespread disorder. Skin biopsies showed diminution and degeneration of the elastic fibres. The light-microscopic features were subdivided in relation to the various skin manifestations. Ultrastructure of the skin showed various amounts of electron-dense, amorphous material and loosely bound microfibrils in and around elastic and collagen fibres as well as some microfibrils with knobs in the interfibrouer, were found normal. It is suggested that the first changes in the elastic fibres induced an inflammatory response and mild mucinous changes of the collagen fibres. Furthermore elastic fibres seemed to be replaced by newly formed collagen.",
    "output": "The primary clinical manifestation in the 44-year-old man with acquired cutis laxa was an erythema (redness) of the chest. This was followed by the development of persistent circumscribed lesions in other areas of the skin, which spread into large erythematous plaques with loose skin. This suggests that the skin was stretched and thin, a common characteristic of cutis laxa. The case also indicates chronic and widespread disorder, with additional symptoms such as slight restrictive ventilatory insufficiency, elongation of the vocal cord, and diverticulosis of the colon. These symptoms are likely related to the degeneration and replacement of elastic fibres in the skin, as seen in the skin biopsies."

    "input": "Twenty-one unselected patients with recurrent nephrolithiasis and normocalcemic hypercalciuria with or without hypophosphatemia and 18 normal subjects were studied with an oral calcium tolerance test and for 3- to 5-day periods while consuming a low normal (400 mg) and high-normal (1000 mg) calcium intake. The oral calcium tolerance test consisted of the measurement of the calcemic, calciuric, and parathyroid (assessed by determinations of serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone and nephrogenous cAMP) responses to acute 1000- or 350-mg doses of calcium. Nineteen patients displayed normal results for basal serum calcium, parathyroid function, and fasting calcium excretion, and striking calcemic (mean increase in serum calcium, 0.9 vs. 0.2 mg/dl in the normal subjects) and calciuric (mean increase in urinary calcium, 0.33 vs. 0.15 mg calcium/100 ml GF in the normal subjects) responses to the 1000-mg calcium tolerance test, associated with a mean 54% suppression in nephrogenous cAMP. These patients were operationally defined as having \"absorptive\" hypercalciuria. The variable occurrence of hypophosphatemia in this group suggested that the pathogenesis of \"absorptive\" hypercalciuria may be complex and/or multifactorial. There were strong positive correlations between the calciuric response to the calcium tolerance test and fractional isotopic calcium absorption (r = 0.75, P less than 0.00), the calcemic responses to the test (r = 0.71, P less than 0.001) and the calciuric responses noted on the 1000- vs. the 400-mg daily calcium intake (r = 0.78, P less than 0.001). Two patients displayed low or low normal basal serum calcium, increased parathyroid function, increased fasting calcium excretion, and a striking calciuric but minimal calcemic response to the 1000-mg calcium tolerance test, associated with a moderate suppression in nephrogenous cAMP. These patients were operationally defined as having \"renal\" hypercalciuria. Several lines of evidence indicated that the hyperparathyroidism in these patients was physiological or secondary, including the near normalization of parathyroid function on the daily 1000-mg calcium intake. A steep slope of calcium excretion on calcium intake (due to increased calcium absorption) was noted in all hypercalciuric patients and accounted for the significantly improved diagnostic accuracy of screening patients for hypercalciuria on the high-normal calcium intake. The simple measurement of total cAMP excretion (nanomoles per 100 ml GF) and urinary calcium on the 1000-mg daily calcium intake seemed to provide reliable separation of patients with \"renal\" from those with \"absorptive\" hypercalciuria. A physiological (350 mg) dose of oral calcium produced a 30% suppression of nephrogenous cAMP in normal subjects; this suggests that dietary calcium exerts an important control of parathyroid function under physiological circumstances.",
    "output": "The mean increase in serum calcium in patients with \"absorptive\" hypercalciuria after the 1000-mg calcium tolerance test was 0.9 mg/dl. This is significantly higher than the mean increase in serum calcium in normal subjects, which was 0.2 mg/dl."

    "input": "To disclose a parathyroid-independent calcium modulation of phosphate transport along the nephron, the effect of increasing plasma calcium concentration to subnormal levels in rats 6 days after parathyroidectomy (chronic PTX) was studied. Fractional phosphate reabsorption was significantly increased. The whole kidney response to calcium infusion was similar whether or not the thyroid gland was removed, which suggests that calcitonin is not involved. The micropuncture study indicated an increase in the reabsorptive capacity for phosphate (absolute reabsorption/absolute delivered phosphate per nephron segment) in the proximal tubule, the loop, and the terminal nephron when calcium was infused. Thus, the level of plasma calcium or some related factor affects the phosphate transport by the tubule independently of parathyroid hormone. With calcium infusion, the profile of phosphate reabsorption along the nephron became close to that of acutely parathyroidectomized rats, but with persisting differences. The level of plasma calcium concentration may partly account for the differences between the acute and the chronic steps of parathyroidectomy. The role of possible interferences between alterations of extracellular calcium concentration or some related factor and the adenylate cyclase-cyclic AMP system in such an action of calcium was evaluated. Cyclic AMP was infused so as to achieve a 10(-6) M plasma concentration. Combined infusions of calcium and cyclic AMP were also performed. The results are compatible with calcium inhibition of adenylate cyclase, although they do not rule out a direct action of calcium.",

This effect was observed throughout the nephron, including the proximal tubule, the loop, and the terminal nephron.

Hypercalcemia (serum calcium 12-15 mg/100 ml) blunted the phosphaturic response to volume expansion, both when serum calcium was raised acutely during volume expansion and when volume expansion was induced in rats with sustained hypercalcemia. These changes were not associated with significant variations in glomerular filtration rate and serum concentration of phosphorus. Hypercalcemia failed to alter the phosphaturic response and the increase in urinary cyclic AMP excretion following both continuous infusion and a single injection of parathyroid extract. These results are consistent with two components of tubular reabsorption of phosphorus. The first is suppressed by extracellular volume expansion and stimulated by hypercalcemia. The second is suppressed by parathyroid hormone and is not affected by hypercalcemia.",

In patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism, impairment in renal responses to PTH was more generalized than has been recognized. The patterns of response varied from patient to patient. The most commonly observed abnormality, aside from lack of increase in urinary cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) was failure to decrease the calcium to sodium clearance ratio, and indication of impaired renal calcium reabsorption. The responses which most closely approximated normal, including a normal decrease in the calcium to sodium clearance ratio, occurred in a patient (Case 1) who had the largest, although impaired, response in cyclic AMP excretion. Conversely, the most abnormal responses occurred in three patients (Cases 2, 4 and 5) who had the smallest increases in cyclic AMP excretion after the administration of PTH. The impaired renal reabsorption of calcium after the administration of PTH (lack of decrease in calcium to sodium clearance ratio) may, when present, be in part responsible for hypocalcemia.",

These same determinations were repeated in five of the prednisone-treated patients during the course of a seven-day calcium infusion. Prior to the infusion, the prednisone-treated patients demonstrated significantly elevated serum levels of PTH (P less than .005) and increased rates of urinary phosphate and cAMP excreation (P less than .005) when compared with normal subjects. After initiation of calcium infusion, the previous elevations in all of these determinations decreased to near normal levels.

Basal plasma concentrations of calcium, alkaline phosphatase and 25-hydroxy vitamin D tended to be low. Plasma immunoreactive PTH levels were at the upper normal range in two patients. A marked increase in urinary cyclic AMP in all patients was solely due to an increase in the nephrogenous cAMP. After vitamin D treatment urinary cAMP was essentially unchanged with the same preponderance of nephrogenous cAMP. Following PTH infusion plasma cAMP showed a brisk rise. There was also a prompt rise in urinary cAMP and a distinct decrease in the calcium to sodium clearance ratio indicating increased calcium reabsorption. Phosphaturic effect was only observed when PTH was given in the highest dose level.

    "input": "Studies were carried out to evaluate whether skeletal resistance to acute increments in endogenous parathyroid hormone exists in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. Hypocalcemia was induced with the infusion of ethyl-enediamine-tetra-acetate (EDTA) in 10 normal subjects and 13 patients with mild renal failure. After the induction of hypocalcemia, the concentration of serum calcium increased gradually and reached preinfusion levels by 22 h in the normal subjects; in contrast, the levels of serum calcium in patients with mild renal insufficiency were significantly lower than the preinfusion values even at the end of 26 h following the EDTA infusion. This delayed recovery occurred despite significantly higher levels of serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (IPTH) in the patients than in the normal subjects. The increase in the levels of IPTH reflect elevations in the concentrations of biologically active hormone since urinary cyclic AMP increased significantly. Urinary calcium excretion following the EDTA infusion was not different in both groups and, therefore, could not account for the delayed recovery of serum calcium values in the patients with renal insufficiency. These results indicate that secondary hyperparathyroidism exists early in patients with renal failure and such patients have exaggerated parathyroid hormone secretion in response to acute hypocalcemia. The data are consistent with the concept that skeletal resistance to increments in endogenous parathyroid hormone is present in such patients. This abnormality is, at least partly, responsible for the hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism of renal insufficiency.",

The percentage changes were, respectively, +35% and -47% when a N-terminal antiserum measuring predominantly the glandular PTH was used.  Only relatively small changes, respectively, +3% and -17%, were found using a C-terminal antiserum which detects preferentially smaller PTH fragments.  Predialysis serum PTH concentration increases significantly with increasing duration of repetitive hemodialysis treatment using an intermediate (6 and 6.4 mg/100 ml) concentration of calcium in the dialysate.  No such increase could be found in two other groups of patients treated with high-calcium (7.5 mg/100 ml) dialysis.  Moreover, a significant but temporary decrease in predialysis serum PTH concentration occurred two months after a rise in dialysate calcium concentration from 6 to 7.5 mg/100 ml.  Treatment with pharmacologic doses of vitamin D3 in selected patients (renal osterdystrophy or children) always resulted in a definite suppression of serum PTH concentration during 14 treatment periods in ten patients.  After cessation of vitamin D3 treatment, serum PTH concentration returned to high levels in four out of five patients.  These data fail to confirm the long-term involution of secondary hyperparathyroidism using high-calcium dialysis.  Vitamin D treatment, however, results in a much more pronounced decrease in serum PTH concentrations, but sustained therapy is necessary.",

Mithramycin produced significant hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, and also significantly and simultaneously increased the plasma parathyroid hormone concentration. Despite the increase in parathyroid hormone, the hypocalemia persisted because of the probable blocking effect which mithramycin exerted on the osteoclasts.

All responded to parenteral parathyroid extract by increasing serum ionized calcium and urinary cyclic AMP, indicating parathyroid-hormone-responsive target organs. Calcitonin and glucagon concentrations were increased above normal in some patients, but there was no relation with serum ionized calcium. Parenteral glucagon had no significant effect on serum ionized calcium or calcitonin concentrations.

In this patient the systolic anterior motion was evident in the presence of mitral valve stenosis. The other patient with mild aortic stenosis and a previously repaired coarctation of the aorta also had mild systolic anterior motion and a small subaortic systolic pressure gradient.

The diagnosis was confirmed by selective angiographic studies. Two technical points are emphasized: first, that the exposure through a midsternal incision is excellent, and second, that the anomalous vein must be detached from its connection to the innominate or subclavian artery as high into the left chest as it is technically possible to reach. Postoperative cardiac catheterization and angiograms confirm the completeness of the repair.",

    "input": "We have initiated an investigation of the proteins bound in vivo to the 2-micrometer DNA plasmid found in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by examining its intracellular form. To isolate 2-micrometer DNA without disturbing proteins bound to the plasmid, an extract was prepared from a strain lacking mitochondrial DNA and the nuclear chromatin was removed from the extract by centrifugation. When the DNA in this extract was sedimented through a sucrose gradient containing 0.15 M NaCl, plasmid DNA had a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 70. This S value is greater than the S value of 25 for naked, superhelical 2-micrometer DNA. Cosedimenting with the DNA were proteins of the same size as the histone proteins associated with yeast nuclear chromatin. Digestion of the plasmid DNA with micrococcal nuclease and electrophoresis of the resulting DNA fragments revealed that segments of discrete sizes are protected from degradation. Examination of the plasmid DNA protein complex by electron microscopy showed nucleosome structures. We conclude that 2-micron DNA exists as a condensed chromosome body within the cell.",

    "input": "Chromosome-size yeast DNA molecules with a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 3-4 X 10(8) were isolated from sucrose gradients after sedimentation of lysed yeast spheroplasts. Resedimentation showed that the molecules were isolated without introducing appreciable single-strand or double-strand breaks. The presence of cross-links in these molecules was suggested by the observation that the apparent Mn in alkali was greater than expected for separated single strands. Since cross-linked molecules would have strands which fail to separate upon denaturation, this was tested more directly. Neutralization of alkaline denaturing conditions resulted in up to 70% of the intact molecules rapidly reforming duplex structures, as shown by equilibrium banding in CsCI. Experiments with larger E. coli DNA molecules (Mn = 5.2 X 10(8)) indicated that the conditions used were sufficient to denature completely molecules of this size. Results of enzyme treatments suggest that the cross-links are not RNA or protein. Experiments with density-labeled yeast DNA molecules showed that the rapid reformation of duplex DNA is not the consequence either of a bimolecular reaction between separated DNA strands or of intrastrand renaturation. The data indicate that when the yeast DNA molecules are completely denatured, the strands fail to separate. Hence they must be cross-linked. Experiments with sheared DNA show that there are small number of cross-links, one to four, permolecule.",

After labeling the cells with L-[Me-3H]methionine and [14C]deoxycytidine, relative rates of enzymic DNA methylation were computed on the basis of radioactivities found in pyrimidine residues of the nuclear DNA.

The amount of this DNA increased with increasing time of replication in the presence of cycloheximide and was greatly decreased when replication was inhibited with 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (cytosine arabinoside). This DNA is considered to be \"free\" DNA because it has the same diameter as marker PM2 DNA and it is preferentially sensitive to DNase I digestion. Reversal of the cycloheximide block resulted in a burst of histone synthesis and repair of the depleted chromatin within 5 min. In addition, 26 presumptive replication forks were observed with beaded chromatin on two arms and free DNA on the third. These results suggest that new histones are usually deposited onto new DNA, that the cellular histone pool is very small, that histone migration is minimal in vivo for at least 18 hr, that for most fibers nuclesome assembly and segregation is conservative for stretches of DNA as long as 100 kbases, and that some part of the octameric histone core may remain bound to DNA during the replication process. The regularity we have observed for the assembly and segregation of nucleosomes is likely to be important for our understanding of how chromosomal information is segregated during development.",

However, when replication was inhibited with 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (cytosine arabinoside), the amount of \"free\" DNA was greatly decreased. This suggests that the inhibition of replication with cytosine arabinoside led to a decrease in the amount of \"free\" DNA.

Irradiation both in vivo and in vitro was used as a molecular probe of the constraints on DNA packaging in the bacterial chromosome. The number of domains of supercoiling was estimated to be approximately 180 per genome equivalent of DNA, based on measurements of relaxation caused by single-strand break formation in folded chromosomes gamma irradiated in vivo and in vitro. Similar estimates based on the target size of ribonucleic acid molecules responsible for maintaining the compact packaging of the nucleoid predicted negligible unfolding due to the formation of ribonucleic acid single-strand breaks at doses of up to 10 krad; this was born out by experimental measurements. Unfolding of the nucleoid in vitro by limit digestion with ribonuclease or by heating at 70 degrees C resulted in DNA complexes with sedimentation coefficients of 1,030 +/- 59S and 625 +/- 15S, respectively. The difference in these rates was apparently due to more complete deproteinization and thus less mass in the heated material. These structures are believed to represent intact, replicating genomes in the form of complex-theta structures containing two to three genome equivalents of DNA. The rate of formation of double-strand breaks was determined from molecular weight measurements of thermally unfolded chromosomal DNA gamma irradiated in vitro. Break formation was linear with doses up to 10 krad and occurred at a rate of 0.27 double-strand break per krad per genome equivalent of DNA (1,080 eV/double-strand break). The influence of possible nonlinear DNA conformations on these values is discussed.",

The folded chromosome and the membrane fragment were each stable in the absence of the other; a 1,700S folded chromosome was obtained after removal of the membrane by a Sarkosyl treatment, and a 4,000S membrane fragment remained after digestion of the chromosomal DNA with deoxyribonuclease I. The interaction between the folded chromosome and the membrane fragment was stable, and, even when the DNA was unfolded, both components remained associated and cosedimented. The large frictional effect of the unfolded DNA reduced the sedimentation rate of the complex to about 2,000S. Partial removal of this unfolded DNA with restriction endonucleases caused the membrane fragments and the remaining associated DNA to sediment faster, at about 3,500S. The DNA remaining associated with the membrane fragments after restriction endonuclease treatment, about 4.5% of the total DNA when EcoRI was used, was indistinguishable from the DNA released from the membranes by three criteria: (i) DNA size distribution in agarose gels after electrophoresis, (ii) reassociation kinetics, and (iii) thermal elution from hydroxylapatite. This finding, that random DNA sequences rather than specific ones were responsible for the majority of the DNA-membrane interactions, argues against the folded chromosome's being a static structure with specific DNA sequences interacting with the cell envelope.",

Both native and denatured DNA are methylated by the enzyme; with calf thymus DNA the double stranded form is the better substrate but the enzyme preferentially methylates single stranded E.coli DNA even in \"native\" preparations. Our results do not support a mechanism whereby the enzyme methylates DNA by binding irreversibly and \"walking\" along it. By measuring maximum levels of methylation of DNAs from different sources we have estimated the proportion of unmethylated sites present in them.

Both fractions contain a DNA replication complex consisting of a number of enzymes involved in synthesizing DNA or DNA precursors, as well as RNA polymerase activity. However, the specific activity of DNA polymerase in the light fraction is much greater than that in the heavy fraction. In addition, the following results suggest that the former is concerned primarily with replication of the genome while the latter has characteristics of a repair function for the genome. (1) newly synthesized DNA can be detected within 30 s in the light fraction but not until 4 min in the heavy fraction. (2) an RNA-DNA single-stranded hybrid can be demonstrated during initial stages of DNA synthesis in the light, but not heavy fraction. (3) extensive semiconservative DNA replication occurs in the light fraction, whereas little such replication is detected in the heavy fraction. (4) DNA polymerase activity in the light fraction has several of the characteristics of a polymerase identified by others as being concerned with normal DNA replication, such as inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide, and relatively high rates of chain elongation (4.9 x 10(4) nucleotides/min).

It is confirmed that spindle systems generally appear to consist of individual receptors. Stimulation effects of fast motor fibres (conduction velocities greater than 12 m/sec) on the spindles of the same muscle were studied. Receptors were isolated with their nerves and the appropriate spinal roots, the latter ones were used for stimulating efferent fibres and recording sensory discharges. Single shocks to the ventral root filaments caused afferent responses ranging from a single action potential to a train of impulses. During repetitive stimulation (train of stimuli at frequency of 10 to 150/sec) a marked increase in afferent activity was found. Afferent activity could be driven by the frequency of stimuli (\"driving\") and the stimulus/action potentials ratio varied from 1:1 to 1:3 or more. The rate of sensory discharge depended on the frequency of stimuli: the maximum effect, was attained at 30 to 50 stimuli/sec and, in the most responsive receptors, up to 80 stimuli/sec. Slight increases of the initial lengths of the receptors caused facilitation of sensory responses to motor stimulation. Moreover, impairing effects, which appear during sustained or high-frequency stimulation, possibly related to fatigue in intrafusal neuromuscular transmission, could be relieved by increasing the initial length. The repetitive stimulation of fast fusimotor fibres increased both dynamic and static responses and also raised the afferent activity after a period of stretching, when usually a depression occurs; these effects varied according to the preparation, its initial tension and the frequency of stimulation. The main feature of the examined motor fibres, when stimulated, is the constant excitatory action on muscle spindle static response. Results are discussed. It is suggested that the different characteristics of intrafusal muscle fibres, the receptor initial tension and the frequency of motor units discharges, may together affect muscle spindles static or dynamic performance.",

The tension responses to ramp-shaped shortenings at different rates of shortening have been recorded. The tension course during the ramp is described in terms of a damped elastic element. In addition a maximum value for an additional series elastic element is estimated. 2. The tension reponses to pulse-shaped shortenings have been recorded. At least 15 ms after the pulse a minimum in tension is found, which depends on amplitude and duration of the pulse. This effect is optimal at a pulse duration of about 6 ms. It is concluded that within 15 ms after the pulse detachment of crossbridges occurs. 3. Muscles were incubated with the metabolic inhibitors IAA and FAA or IAA and FDNB. After repeated stimulation, but before the muscle passes into the rigor state, the fast recovery and the plateau in the responses to quick shortenings are either diminished or abolished, depending on the amplitude of the shortening.

    "input": "1. The mechanical behaviour of intrafusal muscle fibres during fusimotor stimulation and passive stretch was observed directly in muscle spindles isolated from the cat tenuissimus muscle. 2. Mammalian intrafusal muscle fibres are of three functional types. Most spindles contain one slow nuclear bag fibre, one fast nuclear bag fibre, and four or five nuclear chain fibres. 3. Contraction in slow nuclear bag fibres is characterized by a long latency and very slow initial velocity, whereas the latency for the other intrafusal fibres is short and the inital velocity rapid. The mean time for maximum contraction (at 75 Hz to 100 Hz) and relaxation is significantly longer for slow nuclear bag fibres (0-8s) than for other intrafusal fibres (0-5 s). The contraction time of fast nuclear bag fibres is sometimes longer than that of nuclear chain fibres but the mean values are not significantly different; a difference in the time to attain 90% contraction is more obvious. 4. At low stimulation frequencies (10 Hz) contraction in slow nuclear bag fibres and in most fast nuclear bag fibres is smooth whereas nuclear chain fibres exhibit marked oscillations. Single stimuli elicit small local twitches in nuclear chain fibres and occasionally in fast nuclear bag fibres but produce no visible effect in slow nuclear bag fibres. 5. Maximum contraction of slow and fast nuclear bag fibres at body temperature is attained at a stimulation frequency of 75 Hz to 100 Hz, whereas a frequency of 150 Hz or more is required for maximum contraction of nuclear chain fibres. At 50 Hz at body temperature contraction in nuclear bag fibres is at least half the maximum, whereas in many spindles nuclear chain fibres show only a very small contraction at this frequency. 6. Contraction in slow nuclear bag fibres occurs at one or two discrete foci, most of which lie in the intracapsular region beyond the end of the fluid space. Weak contraction extends the primary sensory spiral by a small amount (2%-8%) at a low velocity (5%-10%s-1). When the fibre is passively stretched the spiral opens and then creeps back to about 75% of the extension at the end of the stretch due to yielding in the poles of fibre; creep is complete in 0-5s to 2-5s. 7. Contraction in fast nuclear bag fibres also occurs at one or two discrete foci, most of which lie in the intracapsular region beyond the end of the fluid space. Shortening of sarcomeres at the foci and extension of the sensory spiral are, however, up to eight times greater (up to 25%) than in slow nuclear bag fibres, and the velocity of stretch of the spiral is three to eight times greater (25%-40%s-1). Fast nuclear bag fibres exhibit little or no creep following passive stretch. 8. Contraction in the nuclear chain fibre bundle is localized to the intracapsular region, centered on a point in the intracapsular region between 0-9 mm and 1-6 mm from the spindle equator. Maximal contraction stretches primary and secondary sensory endings by 15% to 20%, at 30% to 40% s-1...",

The changes in fiber diameter and per cent composition of type I and type II fibers plus muscle weights were evaluated along the course of denervation-reinnervation curve at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 weeks postnerve crush. The study revealed that in the early denervation phase (up to 2 weeks postcrush) both the slow and fast muscles, soleus and plantaris, resepctively, atrophied similarly in muscle mass. Soleus increased in the number of type II fibers, which may be attributed to \"disuse\" effect. During the same period, the type I fibers of soleus atrophied as much or slightly more than the type II fibers; whereas the type II fibers of plantaris atrophied significantly more than the type I fibers, reflecting that the process of denervation, in its early stages, may affect the two fiber types differentially in the slow and fast muscles. It was deduced that the type I fibers of plantaris may be essentially different in the slow (soleus) and fast (plantaris) muscles under study. The onset of reinnervation, as determined by the increase in muscle weight and fiber diameter of the major fiber type, occurred in soleus and plantaris at 2 and 3 weeks postcrush, respectively, which confirms the earlier hypotheses that the slow muscles are reinnervated sooner than the fast muscles.

Fibre histograms revealed that the afferent fibres of groups I, II and III had regenerated, while of the efferent fibres only those corresponding to the alpha group had regenerated.

An human subjects, vibration of amplitude 1-5 mm and frequency 20-220 Hz was applied to the tendons of muscles in the leg to examine the effects on the discharge of primary and secondary endings during manoeuvres designed to alter the level of fusimotor drive. 2. In four experiments, the peroneal nerve was completely blocked with lidocaine proximal to the recording site in order to de-efferent spindle endings temporarily. The responses to muscle stretch and vibration, as seen in multi-unit recordings and in single unit recordings, were similar during the block as in the relaxed state prior to the block. Thus, these experiments provided no evidence for a functionally effective resting fusimotor drive. 3. The responses to vibration of nine primary endings and four secondary endings were examined during isometric voluntary contractions of the receptor-bearing muscles. Providing that the endings were responding submaximally in the relaxed state, voluntary contraction enhanced the response to vibration, suggesting co-activation of the fusimotor system sufficient to compensate for mechanical unloading. Unloading effects were observed during contractions of neighbouring synergistic muscles, indicating a close spatial relationship between the co-activated skeletomotor and fusimotor outflows. 4. Recordings were obtained from ten primary endings and seven secondary endings during isometric reflex contractions resulting from the vibratory stimulus (TVR contractions). For twelve endings, the appearance of the tonic vibration reflex in the receptor-bearing muscle resulted in a significant decrease in the response to vibration, suggesting that the endings were unloaded by the extrafusal contraction. On voluntary suppression of the reflex contraction spindle responses reverted to their previous levels. 5. These results suggest that the tonic vibration reflex, like the tendon jerk reflex, operates predominantly or exclusively on alpha motoneurones and that it does not utilize the same cortically originating efferent pathways as are used in the performance of voluntary contractions.",

During voluntary fast alternating finger and foot movements, simulating the tremor of Parkinsonism, two types of discharges were seen in the Ia afferent fibres: (1) stretch responses occurring during the flexor relaxation phases, and (2) discharges occurring during the flexor contraction phases. Contrary to the stretch responses the spindle contraction discharges could be eliminated by a partial lidocaine block of the muscle nerve proximal to the recording site, indicating that they resulted from fusimotor activation of intrafusal fibres. On the basis of the temporal relations between the beginning and end of individual EMG-bursts, the start of the spindle contraction discharges and the latency of the stretch reflex in the muscles concerned, the following conclusions were drawn: the recurrent extrafusal contractions in movements of this type are initiated by the fast direct alpha route, but individual contraction phases generally last long enough to be influenced subsequently by the coactivated fusimotor loop through the spindles. It is postulated that this gamma loop influence during alternating movements helps to keep flexor and extensor muscles working in a regular reciprocal fashion with contractions adjusted in strength to the external loads.",

These consisted in a rearrangement of the enzyme activity pattern of energy-supplying metabolism, e.g. decrease in glycogenolytic and glycolytic enzyme activities and severalfold increase in key enzymes of aerobic endoxidation of substrates in beta-oxidation and the citric acid cycle. Concomitant with the increase in aerobic oxidative capacity, there was an increased resistance to fatigue. Histochemical studies revealed a strong increase in mitochondria of all fibres. The bimodal distribution of fibre cross-sectional area in the normal tibialis anterior muscle was changed by stimulation into a more homogeneous population of fibres with a smaller cross-sectional area. Despite a 50% increase in time to peak of isometric twitch contraction no changes were observed in the fibre population with regard to myofibrillar ATPase reaction in quantitative evaluation of whole cross-sections of the muscles. The percentage of fibres histochemically classified as slow amounted to 2.8% and 3.1% in control and stimulated tibialis anterior muscle. Nevertheless the data suggest a transformation of the fibre population under the influence of long-term intermittent stimulation.",

    "input": "1. The fatigue in rat anterior tibial (a.t.) motor units was studied and related to microphotometric determinations of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity of the motor unit muscle fibres. 2. Anterior tibial contains fast-twitch type II fibre units with an average contraction time of 11 msec and about 5% slow-twitch type I fibre units with an average contraction time of 20 msec. 3. In type II fibres stained for SDH, absorbance varied continuously from 0.046 to 0.569 and inversely to fibre size, except for the largest fibres. 4. Resistance to fatigue of fast motor units to 100 Hz intermittent stimulation varied continuously within a wide range in near linear relations to absorbance for SDH of unit fibres and inversely to tetanic tension, except for motor units with the largest fibres and the largest tetanic tension. 5. Neither resistance to fatigue nor SDH activity lent itself to any categorization of motor units or fibres into well demarcated functional or histochemical types, since both parameters varied continuously in the unit and fibre population of the muscle. 6. The direct relation between resistance to fatigue of fast-twitch motor units and SDH activity of unit fibres appeared valid for fatigue resistance of: (a) neuromuscular transmission, tested with 100 Hz intermittent stimulation which gave concomitant failure of electrical and mechanical response, (b) excitation--contraction coupling,  demonstrated by post-stimulatory depression of twitch tension with preserved maximum tetanus tension and action potential, and (c) contractile mechanism; excitation--contraction coupling?, tested with low frequency stimulation which gave decline of twitch and maximum tetanus tension with preserved action potential. 7. It is suggested that the endurance of each link in the chain of events leading to contraction, including neuromuscular junction and the excitation--contraction coupling system, is under aerobic conditions matched to the contractile capacity of the fibre expressed by its oxidative enzyme activity.",
    "output": "The context does not provide specific information about the average contraction time of slow-twitch type I fibre units in the human anterior tibial muscle. However, it does mention that about 5% of the anterior tibial muscle in rats contains slow-twitch type I fibre units with an average contraction time of 20 msec. Since the human and rat muscles may have differences in their fiber composition and properties, the contraction time of slow-twitch type I fibre units in the human anterior tibial muscle may be different. Therefore, I don't know the average contraction time of slow-twitch type I fibre units in the human anterior tibial muscle."

    "input": "1. Single unit and multi-unit recordings of muscle spindle activity were made from the peroneal nerves of human subjects. While the subjects attempted to maintain a constant ankle joint position, an external load on the receptor-bearing muscle was altered unexpectedly. 2. The spindle discharge produced by a sudden increase in load was of similar strength when the receptor-bearing muscle was relaxed as when it was contracting at the moment of the impact. A motor response at a latency consistent with a spinal reflex mechanism occurred only when the muscle was contracting. It is concluded that the potentiation of the reflex mechanism during contraction was not due primarily to a fusimotor action. 3. Sudden decrease in load produced a pause in spindle discharge followed by a pause in on-going e.m.g. activity at a latency consistent with spinal reflex mechanisms. 4. Slow changes in load produced parallel changes in e.m.g. and spindle discharge. It is suggested that the voluntary effort involved in maintaining joint position in the face of gradually changing loads results in corticospinal activity adjusted in strength to the opposing torque and operating on alpha and gamma motoneurones in parallel.",

Except in the patient with the lowest glomerular filtration rate, the increased net acid excretion was due mostly to increased ammonium excretion. Urine pH decreased initially in each patient, but in the three patients with the highest filtration rates, it increased subsequently as ammonium excretion increased, indicating that renal ammonia production increased. Urinary ammonium excretion correlated inversely with serum potassium concentration and did not decrease on discontinuation of therapy if hyperkalemia was prevented from recurring. In patients with renal acidosis and hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, administration of mineralocorticoid hormone can augment both renal hydrogen-ion secretion and, by correction of hyperkalemia, renal ammonia production, and thereby ameliorate metabolic acidosis.",

However, neither the ability to lower urine pH nor to excrete titratable acid and ammonium after NH4Cl acid-loading was altered.

In some formers, Mg was lower than in normals, whereas Ca was unusually high resulting in a significantly higher molar Ca/Mg ratio (p less than 0.001). 2. In 3 out of 4 stone groups Na excretion was significantly elevated because of reduced tubular reabsorption. In normals, fractional Na excretion varied between 0.44 and 0.54% of endogenous creatinine clearance, whereas it exceeded 1% in the stone patients. Conversely, the molar ratio Na/Ca was equal in all groups. 3. Fasting urinary cyclic AMP was comparable in both populations supporting the assumption that in the majority of patients Ca- or Mg- wasting via urine may not be responsible for secondary hyperparathyroidism. In small selected groups, losses of divalent cations may act in concert, leading to stimulation of the parathyroid glands. 4. Correlations between minerals and Na reveal a close relationship between Na, Ca and Mg in terms of clearance and excretion rate in patients and controls. Fractional Na and Ca excretion are correlated in patients but not in normals. This suggests that in the absence of phosphaturia, factors other than extracellular volume expansion and/or hyperparathyroidism are operative in stone disease. 5. The origin of fasting natriuresis and relative hypercalciuria may be ascribed to a change, as yet not causally identified, in distal tubular Na reabsorption.",

Urine osmolality decreased to hypotonic levels, but polyuria did not appear, probably because it was prevented by the reduction of the glomerular filtration rate. Renal failure was reversible on withdrawal of demeclocycline. No other causes than demeclocycline administration could be found to explain the reduction of the glomerular filtration rate and the estimated renal plasma flow.",

In bumetanide-treated animals, mean sodium excretion rose to 12 per cent of the filtered load, while hydrochlorothiazide increased sodium excretion to 4 per cent of the filtered load. After bumetanide, urine pH fell from 6.1 to 5.1 and net hydrogenion excretion increased significantly. After hydrochlorothiazide, urinary pH went from 6.4 to 7.4, and there was no change in net hydrogen ion excretion. Potassium excretion rose to 106+/-22 muEq/min with bumetanide and to 99+/-17 muEq/min with hydrochlorothiazide. These changes in electrolyte excretion occurred despite lack of changes in arterial blood gases, arterial blood pressure, and glomerular filtration rate. In addition, bumetanide did not exert an inhibitory effect on potassium excretion under conditions of potassium loading. It is concluded that bumetanide produces a higher urinary Na+:K+ ratio with a lower pH than hydrochlorothiazide and that renal potassium ion excretion in response to sulfamoyl diuretics is not solely dependent on the rate of sodium excretion.",

This effect was not due simply to expansion of the volume of the extracellular fluid, since the reduction in TmP/GFR after sodium chloride infusion was less marked, nor did it seem to be due entirely to alkalinization of the urine since the maximum increase in urinary pH occurred 20--40 min after the maximum decrease in TmP/GFR.",

Plasma and urine free dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) were measured in six normal male volunteer subjects and the urinary clearance of dopamine was calculated for each subject. 2. The excretion rates for free dopamine in man were greater than could be explained by simple renal clearance. It was concluded that free dopamine must, therefore, be formed in the kidney. 3. Changes in urinary dopamine excretion were studied in four groups of rats initially maintained on low sodium diet and then given equimolar dietary supplements of NaCl, NaHCO3, KCl or NH4Cl, to study the specificity of the previously observed increase in dopamine excretion after increased dietary NaCl. 4. The mean dopamine excretion increased significantly in rats given NaCl, KCl and NH4Cl, whereas dopamine excretion decreased in those given NaHCO3. 5. The failure of dopamine excretion to rise in response to loading with NaHCO3 was unexpected, and argues against a simple effect of volume expansion by the sodium ion. The increase in dopamine excretion with KCl and NH4Cl showed that this response was not specific to the sodium ion.",
    "output": "The study found that in rats given NaHCO3 dietary supplements, dopamine excretion decreased significantly compared to the control groups given NaCl, KCl, or NH4Cl. This suggests that the increase in dopamine excretion observed with increased dietary sodium is not specific to the sodium ion and may not be due to simple volume expansion by the sodium ion. Instead, it seems that the specific mechanism for the increase in dopamine excretion may be more complex and may not be directly related to the presence of sodium ions."

After intravenous potassium chloride administration, maximum excretion of potassium (U,V) was significantly lower in sickle cell patients than in control subjects, and the percentage of potassium load excreted in 5 h was markedly reduced. Urinary potassium excretion after sodium sulfate infusion was also markedly reduced in sickle cell patients compared to control subjects. After 40 mg of oral furosemide, U,V was also diminished in sickle cell patients. Plasma aldosterone response to ACTH and intravenous potassium was similar to that of control subjects. Plasma renin activity increased normally after volume contraction. We conclude that sickle cell patients have a defect in their ability to excrete an acute potassium load that cannot be attributed to abnormal renin or aldosterone secretion. Overall potassium homeostasis is maintained by extrarenal mechanisms during acute potassium loading.",

The signal is expressed automatically as a curve similar to grwoth curves produced by other methods. The technique offers a new, rapid and sensitive means of detecting active micro-organisms and is potentially the basis of rapid automated systems in this field. The impedance changes indicate that the micro-organisms metabolise substrates of low conductivity into products of high conductivity and that the changes are due to the activity of the micro-organisms rather than increase in their numbers. The activity of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Pseudo-monas aeruginosa, Staphyloccus aureus, and Streptococcus faecalis was detected within 2 h with inocula of 10-3 minus 10-5 organisms per ml. Different reactions of bacteria in various media suggest that the method may be applied to the rapid identification of micro-organisms. The inhibitory effect of antibiotics on bacteria was demonstrated within 2 h, indicating that the method may be useful for the rapid determination of bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics and the rapid assay of antibiotics in serum. Correlation of response time to initial inoculum allows estimatin of numbers of viable organisms.

The authors emphasize the possible association of other neurological disorders: cerebellar symptoms in one case, complex tremor in two other cases, marked decrease of photomotor reflexes in one case and disgeusia in another one. The pharmacocinetic study of 4 cases revealed the presence of a low metabolism of the drug in one of them. Polymorphous inclusions have been seen in Schwann cell and endothelial cell cytoplasm in the three patients with electron microscopic study of the nerves. The pathological study of one case showed the demyelination of spinal cord posterior columns. In another case, who died from hepatic coma, the biochemical study of cerebral lipids revealed the low values of cerebrosides and sulfatides in cerebellum and cerebral white matter.",

    "input": "The authors report 4 cases of the morbid familial association revealing itself late in life (average age 37.7 years) including multiple basal cell carcinomas of the face and neurological and psychiatric symptoms, the most complete examples of which were severe, including mixed cerebello-spinal ataxia, involvement of the anterior horns of the spinal cord, a pyramidal syndrome and extra-pyramidal syndrome, abolition of the osteo-tendinous reflexes, dementia, paralysis of certain cranial nerves. These are associated constantly with increased glucose concentration in the cerebro-spinal fluid and dilatation of the cerebral ventricles. The course is unusual. The skin signs always occur first. There is a definite parallel between the severity of the skin involvement and that of the central nervous system. A neuropathological study of one case (case 2) showed lesions of degenerative type resembling spino-cerebellar degeneration of Menzel type with supramedullary diffusion to the locus niger, locus coeruleus, cranial nerves and thalamus. From these clinical and pathological findings, the authors noted an original pathological and clinical entity and consider certain diagnostic and pathological problems. The precise relationship between the skin and nervous lesions is unknown, but may be due to abiotrophic processes. Concerning the classification, this disease should not be included among the phacomatoses for there is no biastema tendency, and should be included among the more general group of neuro-cutaneous dystrophies or genoneurodermatoses.",

    "input": "The neurological manifestations of three adult cases with acquired toxoplasmosis appearing like a focal lesion, multiple sclerosis and with symptoms indicating a cerebellar lesion are reported. The discussion with respect to the literature shows the following results: 1. The diagnosis of mono- and oligosymptomatic toxoplasmosis with neurological symptoms is only approximate after the introduction of the indirect immunofluorescence test too. 2. The toxoplasmosis of the nervous system in the adult is not characterized by a special syndrome like the connatale form. In contrary, it often is mimicking many well known neurological or psychiatric syndromes. 3. There may be an exacerbation of a latent infection in cause of immunosuppressive therapy or radiation of malignancy or after transplantations. 4. Treatment with the combination of pyrimethamine and sulfonamids today is handled less in spite of the possible complications and of doubtful serological results, because an early diagnosis and onset of treatment is important for a good restitution.",

From a semiological point of view, they may be: (i) isolated, (ii) associated with neurological symptoms (ophtalmoplegia, hemiplegia, hemianesthesia...). From an etiological point of view, the haemorragic conditions are predominant (30%): encephalic vascular malformation with or without subarachnoidal haemorragia (21%), subarachnoidal haemorragia without malformation (6%) and subdural haematoma (3%). Two types of conditions are also frequently observed: ischemic attacks (22,3%) and inflammatory meningeal syndromes (12%). Rare cases with hypophyseal adenomas, ischemic attacks under oestro-progestative treatment, accidents of mono-amine-oxydase inhibitors and multiple sclerosis are observed. 23,8% of the cases remained without any precise diagnosis. One of the interesting points in the acute headache issue is the possibility of discovering an encephalic vascular malformation without any important bleeding and, therefore, good conditions for surgery.",

Evidence of neuropathy was obtained in approximately 50% of these patients over the total period. Once dialysis was instituted, distal paresthesiae evident before the inception of dialysis tended to clear rapidly. Occurrence of the symptom of \"restless legs\" correlated positively with the presence of neuropathy. Persistent neuropathy was more commonly sensory than motor, and its features were consistent with a predominant loss of large myelinated fibers. This analysis suggests that multiple factors may be involved in the origin of uremic neuropathy.",

This year should end with a period of 3--4 weeks at the dental school for feedback discussion, seminars and some examinations. In order to involve every dentist, teacher, therapist, hygienist, assistant technician in a well-planned continuing educational program it seems necessary to introduce a compulsory system. It is also suggested that there should be a control system for the quality of care and individual professional performance. The demand for dental care increases. It is therefore highly desirable to utilize modern preventive measures on a broad scale, more effective and careful planning of the dental services for the individual patient and for the community as a whole and increased quality of treatment in order to reach a better prognosis and more ancillary personnel.",

One hundred and five dentists in general dental practice for more than 25 hours per week were studied by means of a questionnaire and by peer review of selected patients. Those forms of continuing education requiring active participation by the dentist rate more highly than more passive forms such as lectures, journals, etc. both in the acceptability to the dentist and in relation to the standard of dental health of his patients. There remain many variables which cannot yet be fully assessed which determine the dentist's perception of need for continuing education and its effectiveness in raising the standard of dental care which he provides for his patients.",

The reports clearly indicated that the professional challenges are changing rapidly as a result of improved treatment habits and dental health among most patients and that continuing dental education should adjust to the new situation. Most interviewers were satisfied with the courses presently offered, but they nevertheless wanted more of them, particularly in oral medicine and surgery, prosthetics, prevention and community dentistry. Scientific papers abounding with statistics and histology were suggested to be reduced in the Norwegian Dental Journal, and should be replaced by practical review papers. Social motives for attending professional meetings were common, the dentists said they learned much of practical value and picked up news in conversations with colleagues. Improved contacts with the dental schools was desired. Concerning undergraduate education, a prevailing view was that too much time was devoted to basic sciences as opposed to clinical- and community dentistry. The attitude towards compulsary continuing education was ambiguous, conceivably a reflection of the two different professional ideals: high standards and autonomy.",

Based on the size, scope, and costs associated with the medical sector, this is understandable. However, this health research focus has often resulted in the casual and perhaps inappropriate generalization of medical findings to the dental sector. The purpose of this paper is to identify and review some of the differences between the profession and practice of dentistry and that of medicine. Differences discussed are those that exist in the respective education systems, work forces, delivery systems, disease entities, patients' perceptions of medical and dental needs, and the financing of services demanded. Researchers and policy leaders alike are urged to weight the significance of these differences as they consider the applicability of medical sector findings to dentistry.",

Where professional and auxiliary dental manpower is in short supply the use of non-dental personnel such as teachers and health educators should be emphasised as a means of providing firrst aid and preventive measures. Manpower remains the central problem in improving oral health. Although the number of dental schools and the total number of dentists has increased in the past two decades, the dentist/population ratio has declined. Considerable variations occur between countries and the geographical distribution within countries is very uneven, an undue proportion often practising within the large cities. A greater increase in numbers of dentists, though desirable, will not be sufficient to solve the problem of adequate dental health coverage in this century. The advanced skills of the dental graduate are not required for many routine procedures and greater use must be made of operating auxiliaries. More research is needed into the best composition of the dental team. Increased use of larger, more complex teams seems likely to be the most important development for the future. This will require a careful reappraisal of the curricula for all categories of personnel.

The quality and interpretation of the data to be used depend on who gathers it. If the dental profession is not in the position to gather the data, others certainly will be. There is a wealth of statistical data in the records of every practice. The record keeping system described provides an organized way to get such information out, with a minimum of additional effort. Rather than making it a series of separate tasks to generate a statistical description of the practice population, the incidence of problems, or the progression of treatments, this record keeping system provides a single comprehensive method. This method grows with a practice, whether individual, group, or clinic. By doing this, it provides a long-range continuous monitor of the practice population and the problems incident to it. The installation of such a methodology in clinics and dental school faculty practices will rapidly contribute to our knowledge regarding dental health care. Adoption in whole or in part by private practioners will provide them with new tools for the delivery of better dental care and practice management.",

In stage B and more advanced breast cancer in young women, the outlook was poorer than in women 41 years and older. When axillary involvement is present during gestation or in the immediate postpartum period, the prognosis is especially poor. Young women have an unusually high proportion (35 percent) of low-grade, infrequently metastasizing tumors, such as medullary, intraductal, papillary, and lobular carcinomas.

There was an excess of bladder cancer patients with some previous occupational exposure, such as rubber, chemicals, and textiles. A weak association with coffee drinking, which appeared to be independent of smoking, was found for males. Users of artificial sweeteners were not over-represented among the cases. The authors conclude that the epidemiologic pattern of bladder cancer cannot be fully accounted for by cigarette smoking and occupational exposure and suggest a series of metabolic studies to assess the role of additional factors, such as nutrition.",

There is a group who have a high risk of developing breast cancer.  The recent improvement in cure rates seems to be jue chiefly to earlier diagnosis rather than to improved methods of therapy.  The physician, by careful periodic breast examinations and by the judicious use of diagnostic aids such as mammography and thermography, especially in the high risk group, has a golden opportunity to pick up cancer in a localized stage where the prognosis for cure with appropriate therapy is excellent.  A tentative diagnosis of breast cancer (Table XI) can be made with a fair degree of accuracy by taking a careful history, utilizing and combining available statistics about the frequency, median age, characteristic symptom complexes of the common breast lesions and factors related to a high mammary carcinoma risk, and by a systematic and thorough breast examination supplemented with diagnostic aids when appropriate.  However, biopsy and histologic examination is mandatory in all patients with a) true, three dimentional, dominant lumps even if diagnostic aids are negative except for cysts which can be safely aspirated under controlled conditions; b) suspicious lesions found by diagnostic aids even though there are no clinical findings; c) serous, serosanguineous, bloody, or watery nipple discharge; and d) other signs of cancer, i.e. eczema of the nipple, axillary adenopathy, etc., in order to determine with absolute accuracy whether the lesion is benign or malignant.",

    "input": "A survey was taken of a selected group of 4,793 oral lesions submitted to the oral pathology biopsy service between 1950 and 1970. About two thirds of all the specimens examined microscopically were classified as inflammatory, infectious, or reactive hyperplasia. Of the 12.6% of the sample classified as neoplasms, one of every five was malignant. Three of every four of the malignant neoplasms were microscopically diagnosed as squamous cell carcinomas. Benign neoplasms were most common in ages 40 to 60, whereas premalignancies and malignancies were most commonly discovered in the slightly older age group of 50 to 70. Although malignant neoplasms were found more often in men than women, there was a striking increase in the incidence of malignancies in women in the second ten-year period of the study. There were unexplainably few malignant neoplasms found in blacks. Patients should be taught to recognize the early signs of oral premalignancy and malignancy through the use of a simple method of self-examination at home. They should be discouraged from the frequent use of tobacco and alcohol, which have long been known to be predisposing factors in the production of oral squamous cell carcinomas.",

    "input": "Forty patients with systemic lupus erythematosus randomly received inactivated bivalent (A/NJ and A/Victoria) influenza vaccine or saline in a double-blind study. During 20 weeks of follow-up, no deterioration in major organ function or increase in disease flares was observed in the immunized group as compared with the group that received saline. Preimmunization antibody titers to A/Victoria were lower in the 40 patients with lupus erythematosus than in age-matched control subjects. Response to immunization, as measured by serum antibody titers, was also lower in the patients with lupus erythematosus, indicating that immune responses must be evaluated on an individual patient basis. Nevertheless, influenza vaccination can be safely carried out in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.",
    "output": "During the 20 weeks of follow-up, no deterioration in major organ function or increase in disease flares was observed in the immunized group compared to the group that received saline. This suggests that influenza vaccination did not negatively impact the health of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus in terms of major organ function or disease activity. However, it's important to note that immune responses to the vaccine may vary on an individual patient basis, as indicated by lower response to immunization in the patients with lupus erythematosus compared to age-matched control subjects. Despite this, the study suggests that influenza vaccination can be safely carried out in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus."

Some regularities of the formation of immunity to individual poliomyelitis virus types in the course of 4 vaccinations with trivalent vaccine were revealed and specified. The results indicate that the contact of vaccine virus with the oropharyngeal tissues during immunization has a favourable effect on the development of immunity. Vaccination of infants under 1 at 6-week intervals between vaccine feedings creates solid immunity in 90--100% vaccines. Administration of the next vaccine dose 6 weeks after the previous one stops multiplication of the dominating type of vaccine virus and prevents its long-term passage in the intestinal tract decreasing the probability of emergence of vaccine virus variants with increased pathogenicity.",

The vaccines had been examined for antigen content by chick cell agglutination (CCA) tests and electron microscopic particle count determinations. Endotoxin and pyrogen content were determined by limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) and rabbit pyrogenicity assays; and egg-associated protein contamination was estimated by total protein and single radial immunodiffusion assays. Although great differences (10-200-fold) were found in the amount of endotoxin or pyrogen in the vaccines, no significant differences were found in the febrile responses they induced. Both bivalent and monovalent vaccines induced fever of greater than or equal to 38 C at a rate of approximately 3 1/2-4% above background. The febrile responses were most frequent at 24 hours after inoculation and a higher rate was observed in children than adults. Local reactions consisting of tenderness, erythema or induration were seen in from 20-57% of the recipients and also were unrelated to the pyrogenic or host-derived materials in the vaccines. Adults had higher local reaction rates than children and some vaccines containing larger amounts of viral antigen induced significantly higher rates of reactivity than did vaccines containing smaller amounts of antigen. Although 37-51% of all recipients experienced either a local and/or febrile reaction to influenza immunization, the reactions were in general mild and would not consitute a significant disadvantage in the immunization of children over 6 years and adults to prevent influenza infection and its sequelae.",

    "input": "1. Post-synaptic excitation produced in motoneurones of the isolated perfused frog spinal cord by different monosynaptic inputs and by ionophoretically applied glutamate was analysed with intracellular recording technique. 2. Ca2+-deficient, high Mg2+ (5--20 mM) media or addition of Mn2+ (2mM) or Co2+ (5 mM) reversibly abolished chemically mediated e.p.s.p.s derived from medullary reticular formation, ventral and lateral columns, but not the short-latency, rapidly rising e.p.s.p.s derived from dorsal roots or muscle nerves, suggesting electric coupling between some primary afferents and spinal motoneurones. This conclusion is consistent with the dynamic properties of dorsal root e.p.s.p.s, their small sensitivity to cooling, and with results of correction of intracellular records made for contribution of extracellular field potential. E.p.s.p.s evoked by ventral root stimulation were also insensitive to Ca2+-lack and presence of 5--10 mM-Mg2+. 3. As the post-synaptic membrane was made more negative the amplitude of electrotonic dorsal root e.p.s.p.s was increased, and it was decreased by depolarizing currents. No reversal of the early part of the electrotonic e.p.s.p. was observed, although the presence of the local response would account for the occasional reversal of its later phase seen with depolarization. 4. When hyperpolarizing and depolarizing currents were applied to motoneurones in which chemically mediated e.p.s.p.s of the reticular cells, the ventral and lateral columns, were evoked, the actual reversal of the early part of e.p.s.p. was not observed, and there was no correlation between the sensitivity of the e.p.s.p.s to injected currents and their time course. The positive values of the extrapolated reversal potentials and the effects of changes in ionic content of perfusing media suggest that synaptically released transmitter triggers off the Na permeability of the subsynaptic membrane. 5. The amplitude of depolarization produced by ionophoretically applied glutamate depends non-linearly on membrane potential and the curvature of this dependence differs from that seen with chemically mediated s.p.s.p.s. The asymptotic nature of this relationship is explicable by a dependence of the membrane conductance change upon the membrane voltage. 6. The results of conductance measurements during the glutamate induced depolarization, the values of apparent reversal potentials and their dependence on external Na+ and K+ and internal Cl- is explicable by the opening post-synaptic channel gates for Na+ and closing post-synaptic channel gates for K+. 7.

However, this effect was not observed for short-latency, rapidly rising e.p.s.p.s derived from dorsal roots or muscle nerves, suggesting electric coupling between some primary afferents and spinal motoneurones in the case of the former but not the latter. This effect is likely due to the impact of the media on the Na permeability of the subsynaptic membrane, as suggested by the positive values of the extrapolated reversal potentials and the effects of changes in ionic content of the perfusing media."

    "input": "The effect of the replacement of extracellular chloride by methylsulphate was investigated on isolated frog atrial trabeculae using the voltage clamp technique. In methylsulphate solution, the following results were obtained: 1. After a transient depolarization of the resting potential, the action potential was lengthened and the diastolic depolarization rate of the repetitive activity was reduced. 2. In voltage clamp conditions, the current-voltage relationships and the steady-state inactivation curves of both early and secondary inward currents were unaffected. 3. The study of the evolution of the instantaneous backgroundd current with membrane potential showed a decrease of the current values. 4. The first component of the time-dependent outward currents was unaffected but the second component was reduced without change of its time-constant value. Assuming the absolute value of the chloride equilibrium potential at about -30 mV, it was suggested that the lengthening of the action potential in methylsulphate solution might be explained by the decrease of an influx of chloride ions which should participate in the repolarization. The reduction of the diastolic depolarization rate might be due to the decrease of an outflux of chloride ions which should be involved in the inward background currents unmasked by the deactivation of the time-dependent outward currents.",

The suberyldicholine-induced conductance increased exponentially from its previous equilibrium level to a new equilibrium level following a step hyperpolarization. 3. For low suberyldicholine concentrations the time constant of this relaxation was independent of the concentration. 4. For low suberyldicholine concentrations the voltage dependence of equilibrium conductance and relaxation time constants was identical. 5. Bungarotoxin pretreatment did not affect the responses beyond a simple reduction in their amplitude. 6. The conductance evoked by high suberyldicholine concentrations was less voltage-sensitive than that evoked by low concentrations. 7. A new model for explaining noise and relaxation data is proposed. This postulates rate-limiting binding steps followed by a voltage-dependent isomerization.",

This relaxation process has a time constant that is independent of the concentration for low suberyldicholine concentrations.

In a solution containing 5 mM K+, the mean hyperpolarization was 1.0+/-0.35 mV. Hyperpolarization was 1.46+/-0.30 mV when the activity of the Na-K pump was blocked by 2 x 10(-5) M ouabain and 1.82+/-0.43 mV when it was blocked by bathing the muscle in a K+-free medium. Reactivation of membrane ATP-ase by addition of potassium after a period in K+-free medium reduced the hyperpolarization to zero, when measurements were made 10-20 min after the readdition. It is concluded that spontaneous non-quantal leakage of acetylcholine occurs at the mouse neuromuscular junction, as it does in the frog (2).

    "input": "Extracellular and intracellular recordings were made in vitro from single neurons of the myenteric plexus of the guinea-pig small intestine. Synthetic substance P was applied to the neurons by means of the perfusing solution or by electrophoresis from micropipettes. Extracellular recording showed that substance P (100 pm-30 nm), applied by perfusion, increased the firing rate of myenteric neurons. Intracellular recording indicated that perfusion with substance P caused a dose-dependent membrane depolarization which was unaffected by hexamethonium, hyoscine, naloxone or baclofen. The depolarization was also evoked by electrophoretic application of substance P. It was associated with an increase in membrane resistance, augmented by membrane depolarization and reduced by membrane hyperpolarization. The relation between the substance P reversal potential and the logarithm of the extracellular potassium concentration was linear with a slope of 54 mV/log10[K+], which indicates that substance P inactivates the resting potassium conductance of the myenteric neurons. This effect on ion conductance is the same as that of an unknown substance that mediates slow synaptic excitations with the myenteric plexus.",

    "input": "1. The effects of Ca2+ deprivation upon mechanical and electrophysiological parameters of single muscle fibres from the m. semitendinosus and the m. iliofibularis of the frog were investigated. 2. When the external free Ca concentration was reduced in steps of one order of magnitude from 10(-3) to 10(-9) M, using up to 10 mM-EGTA and in the presence of 3 mM-Mg2+, the maximum force of K contractures declined by 5-15%, the plateau of maximum force shortened, and in most cases the phase of spontaneous relaxation lengthened. 3. In Ringer solution containing 10(-9) M-Ca2+ and 1 mM-Mg2+ 85% of maximum tetanic force could be maintained for at least 15 sec (5 Hz; 3 degrees C). 4. The reduction of external Ca2+ from 10(-3) to 10(-9) M and its replacement by Mg2+ induced a 20-30 mV shift towards more negative potentials of the 'steady state' inactivation curve (which relates maximum force upon full depolarization to the logarithm of the K concentration or the corresponding membrane potential during the conditioning period). 5. The same alteration in concentrations of divalent cations caused little or no change in the shape and potential dependence of the activation curve (which relates maximum force to the logarithm of the external K concentration of the corresponding membrane potential). 6. The threshold potential for the onset of delayed rectification (point voltage clamp) and that for the initiation of an action potential did not change when external Ca2+ was reduced to 10(-9) M and replaced by Mg2+. 7. When the concentration of EGTA2- was increased to 80 mM (in the presence of 5 mM-Mg2+) twitch height dropped to very small values within a few minutes. However, tetanic force (50 Hz) reaching 20-85% of the original value could still be induced after 1 hr in high EGTA2-. 8. The experiments show that external Ca2+ acts upon excitation-contraction coupling mainly by impeding 'inactivation'. A hypothesis is proposed in which the plateau of maximum force during a contracture is the consequence of a regenerative Cai2+-dependent shift of the inactivation curve towards more positive potentials.",

    "input": "1. Application of voltage clamp pulses (1--10 sec) to frog ventricular strips causes temporary changes in the extracellular K concentration. 2. The changes in the extracellular K concentration can be estimated from (a) slowly decaying post-clamp after-potentials, (b) changes in the action potential duration, and (c) measurements with a K-selective micro-electrode. 3. The depolarization of the resting potential and the shortening of the action potential are present in approximately the same proportions during voltage-clamp induced extracellular K accumulation and during perfusion with a K-ricn Ringer solution but small consistent differences are noticed. 4. The measurements of the after-potential, the action potential shortening, and the K-electrode response were analysed as indicators of extracellular K+ activity and it was concluded that the after-potential provides the most convenient and reliable estimate of the absolute magnitude of the voltage-clamp induced extracellular K accumulation. 5. The depolarizing after-potentials decay more slowly than the hyperpolarizing after-potentials but it is found that this reflects the selectivity of the membrane to K+ concentrations as predicted by the Nernst or the Goldman equations. 6. Analysis of the redistribution of accumulated K+ from the decay of the after-potential suggests that the major part of the redistribution process can be described by a single time constant (2--4 sec). A much longer time constant is required for a smaller component of the 'tail' in order to bring [K]o to the normal resting state. 7. N-shaped relations similar to the 'steady state' current-voltage relation are obtained when the post-clamp after-potential, the action potential shortening, and the K-electrode response are plotted versus the clamped membrane potential. The maxima of these curves are located around -40 mV and the minima around -20 mV. 8. In spite of a significant outward membrane current (1--1.5 microamperemeter) in the minimum region (-20 mV), the post-clamp after-potential is often hyperpolarizing in nature suggesting extracellular K depletion. 9. These findings indicate that the K efflux is lower at -20 mV than at both higher and lower potentials and suggest that the N-shape 'steady state' current-voltage relation mainly reflects the voltage dependency of the K current. 10. A theory for K accumulation in a single compartment is presented which predicts that a simple linear RC-circuit may describe the electrical response of the preparation in a limited potential range around the resting potential. The extracellular accumulation space was estimated to be 13--16% of the total volume of the preparation. It is tentatively suggested that the accumulation space is equivalent to the subendothelial fraction of the extracellular space.",

Due to a non-linearity of the current-voltage curve, the directly-measured reversal potential may be quite different from the value classically determined by extrapolation (linear regression) of the measurements made at potentials below spike threshold. Denervation and changes of external pH were found to alter the shape of the current-voltage relation, but not the directly-measured reversal potential. These effects are tentatively explained on the basis of changes in the ratio: time-to-peak for [ACh] reaching the receptors/mean life-time of the open synaptic channels. Possible changes in cooperativity are also considered.",

The muscle had a mean resting membrane potential of --61-5 mV and normally lacked spontaneous mechanical and electrical activity.  2. Stimulation of intramural nerves with single pulses produced a small depolarization and contraction.  At frequencies greater than 0.5 Hz a second component occurred which had a maximum value of 35--51 mV with short trains at 30 Hz.  Spike potentials were rarely seen.  Depolarization was accompanied by a decrease in membrane resistance.  3. Noradrenaline (3 times 10-minus 5 M) and guanethidine (3 times 10-minus 5 M) both depolarized the membrane and produced contraction.  Initially, oscillations in the membrane potential were oftern seen.  4. Intramural nerve stimulation in the presence of guanethidine damped the oscillations and produced relaxation.  This was accompanied by neither hyperpolarization nor a change in membrane resistance.  5. TEA (1 mM) depolarized the membrane (--47-6 mV) and initiated spontaneous activity.  Field stimulation evoked spikes with overshoot.",

Inhibitory post-synaptic currents (i.p.c.s) were recorded from the feed-back current through a wire electrode inserted longitudinally into the opener muscle fibre of the claw in the crayfish (Cambarus clarkii). 2. I.p.s.c. rose to its peak in about 3-4 msec and decayed approximately exponentially. The decay time constant at -100 mV was 9.4 msec. 3. The decay time constant decreased as the membrane was hyperpolarized and increased during depolarization. The time constant (tau) depends on voltage (V) according to the relation tau = a exp (AV), with a = 18.6 msec and A = 0.0065 mV-1. Voltage dependence was opposite in direction to that seen at frog end-plates, but in the same direction as that of e.p.s.c. in crayfish muscle. 4. At lower temperatures, the rise and fall times of i.p.s.c.s were prolonged. Q10 for the decay time constant was 2.4 between 22.6 and 12.5 degrees C. 5. When pH was decreased from 7.2 to 5.5, the decay time constant increased by about 50%, with little change in the voltage dependence of the time course. 6. When chloride in the solution was changed to iodide, the decay time constant was increased by a factor of 3, while voltage dependence of the time course was not changed. In bromide solution the decay time constant increased by about 50%. 7. Peak amplitudes of i.p.s.c.s were approximately linear as the membrane was depolarized, but they levelled off as the membrane was hyperpolarized beyond reversal potential. The non-linear I-V relation did not result from inadequate voltage clamping, nor from a change in the inside concentration of chloride. After equilibration with iodide solution the I-V relation was approximately linear. 8. The decay time constant was increased after repetitive nerve stimulation. This prolongation became more pronounced at lower temperatures. 9. The kinetic process of the transmitter action is discussed. It is suggested that the rate limiting process for i.p.s.c. is binding and unbinding of the transmitter to the receptor.",

Analysis of prognostic parameters reveals the importance of the quality of the left ventricule, whilst age, sex, risk factors, the site of the bypass, the number of stenoses and the type of angina had little or no statistical influence on postoperative mortality.

Postoperative follow-up was complete for 99% of the patients. There were 15 late deaths (3%) and the rates of survival at 2 and 4 years were 94.4% and 92.1% respectively. The actuarial curve of survival after surgery was not significantly different from that of the general population. After a mean follow-up of 27 months 73% of the patients were completely free of angina and 19% were markedly improved. The rate of recurrence of angina averaged 10% per year and the annual infarction rate was 0.7%. Fourteen patients (3%) underwent reoperation during the follow-up period. Thus, coronary revascularization surgery offers effective and sustained relief of incapacitating angina and might also improve survival if the operative mortality is low.",

    "input": "A case of progressive extrinsic ophthalmoplegia associated with peripheral neuropathy and hypertriglyceridemia type IV is described. Motor and sensory conduction velocities of the spinal nerves were severely decreased, while the EMG of the facial muscles was more suggested of a myopathic disorder. Electron microscopic study of biopsies of biceps and peroneus brevis muscles disclosed many ragged red fibers, mainly type I, which contained typical abnormal mitochondria. Other fibers, all type II, contained increased amounts of glycogen between myofibrils or beneath the sarcolemmal membrane, but the mitochondria were normal. These fibers were more abundant in the peroneus brevis than in the biceps muscle. Nerve biopsy revealed marked loss of myelinated fibers, but neither mitochondrial changes nor glycogen storages were evident in Schwann's cells. Biochemical investigations confirmed the increased amount of glycogen in both muscle biopsies and revealed a decrease of guanilcyclase. Phosphorylase, phosphorylase b kinase, adenilcyclase, and carnitine concentrations were all normal. The pathogenesis of this syndrome is discussed and the relationship between mitochondrial abnormalities and glycogen accumulation in muscle tissue are considered.",

Enzyme histochemical and electronmicroscopic techniques were used to study longitudinal fibre splitting and its quantitative relation to the general changes in the biopsies. In 9 cases serial sections were used to study the longitudinal extent and character of fibre splitting. Longitudinal fibre splitting was found in 14 cases. It was prominent in Type 1 fibres, and in those biopsies in which hypertrophy was most marked. It was often associated with central migration of sarcolemmal nuclei. Ultrastructurally there was evidence that splitting consisted of mechanical disruption of the myofibrillar pattern, followed by an active process of membrane formation. We suggest that longitudinal splitting of muscle fibres, induced by overload of poorly innervated, hypertrophied fibres, can account for many of the \"myopathic\" changes found in neurogenic muscular disorders.",

The muscle fibres sometimes showed rough endoplasmic reticulum, annulate lamellae and prominent Golgi apparatus. Thin and thick filamentous inclusions were present both in the sarcoplasm and nuclei of some muscle fibres. Thick filamentous inclusions were seen in chronic cases and were sometimes associated with annulate lamellae. Regeneration of muscle was often conspicuous. The endothelial cells of the blood vessels were hypertrophied; some cells contained granulotubular inclusions, rod-shaped bodies (Weibel-Palade bodies) and filamentous material. The basement membrane of the vessels was often multi-layered. The cells infiltrating the interstitial tissue included macrophages, lymphocytes, transformed lymphocytes, plasma cells, monocytes, mast cells and only occasional eosinophils and basophils. Lymphocytes, macrophages and a few plasma cells were seen between the plasma and basement membranes of degenerating muscle fibres.

These phenomena are limited principally to the upper limbs. In addition we found electromyographical signs of a generalized myotonic syndrome. The histological and histochemical investigations reveal only minimal non-specific signs of myopathy. The activities of CPK and aldolase in the blood serum are increased at times. A normal elevation of venous lactate was observed during ischemic work. The biochemical studies of muscular tissue exhibit normal activities of the analyzed enzymes, especially as regards phosphorylase. An increased concentration of calcium ions in blood serum may be related to the contraction during strenuous work; it is known that calcium ions are an important factor in the contraction-relaxation cycle of striated muscle. The age of manifestation varied from 4 to 33 years in 4 cases of the relatives observed. The disease shows no signs of aggravation as to the severity and extent of the disorders.

    "input": "The following parameters were measured and calculated in 124 consecutive muscle biopsies: mean fiber diameter, standard deviation, percentage of type I and Type II fibers, variability coefficient, hypertrophy and atrophy factor. Twenty percent of the histometrically analyzed biopsies showed a type II atrophy and four percent a type I atrophy. Type II atrophy was found particularly in the following disorders: collagen vascular diseases, steroid myopathies, cachexia and as a result of inactivity. Some neurogenic processes also demonstrated a selective type II atrophy. The combination of a grouped type II atrophy with a type I hypertrophy is characteristic of chronic and usually heredodegenerative disorders of the motoneurons. The presence of a selective type II atrophy argues against a genetically determined muscular dystrophy. A mixed atrophy classified here as strong or very strong primarily suggests a neuropathy. A selective type I hypertrophy has been found exclusively in neurogenic processes, and type II hypertrophy predominantly in the cases of chronic heredodegenerative neurogenic and primarily myopathic diseases. An increase of the variability coefficient of both types of muscle fibers is more frequent and pronounced in neurogenic processes than in myopathic syndromes. Type II fibers show a selective increase in the variability coefficient considerably more often than type I fibers. In contrast to other reports we seldom found a fiber type predominance or a pathological type-grouping. Only two out of five biopsies with pathological fiber type-grouping were definitely neurogenic. In special cases the histometric analysis of muscle fiber types improves the diagnostic efficiency of muscle biopsies.",

    "input": "The Authors describe an adult case of hypothyroid myopathy which occurred after a Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Ultrastructural examination of the deltoid muscle showed two fundamental changes: 1) large collections of mitochondria generally normal in shape, structure and size, especially in the subsarcolemmal sapce of the muscle fibre; 2) glycogen deposits both beneath sarcolemmal membrane and between myofibrils. Histochemical examination reveals an increased activity of mitochondrial oxydative enzymes, such as NADPH and SDH especially in subsarcolemmal regions of many type I fibres. The histogram is normal. It seems that the multiplication of skeletal muscle mitochondria may be compensatory to the slowing down of metabolic activities. This, however, is ineffective because it involves the mitochondria localized more superficially in the fibres with a loosely coupled oxydative phosphorylation. Glycogen accumulations are probably due to deficiency of the thyroid hormone; in fact stimulation of carbohydrate metabolism by thyroxine is well known. The abnormal functioning of the muscular mitochondria and the defective utilisation of glycogen are the most important factors in the pathogenesis of muscular weakness of hypothyroid myopathy.",
    "output": "The likely cause of glycogen accumulations in the skeletal muscle of a patient with hypothyroid myopathy is a deficiency of the thyroid hormone. This deficiency affects the normal functioning of the muscular mitochondria and the utilization of glycogen, leading to their accumulation. The slowing down of metabolic activities and the localization of mitochondria more superficially in the fibers with a loosely coupled oxydative phosphorylation also contribute to the glycogen accumulation."

Histochemical differentiation of skeletal muscle fibres (main fibre types I and II, after Engel) indicated a predominant size reduction in type I fibres on demonstrating myofibrillary ATPase. In addition, demonstration of this enzyme also revealed a marked shift of the fibre type proportions in favour of type I. Isolated reduction in gammaG-globulins was also demonstrated. A defect of cellular and humoral response was excluded.",

Significant numbers of mutations could be induced at all these concentrations. Pronounced germ-cell sensitivity differences were observed. For low exposures, spermatids and spermatocytes were about 10--20 times more sensitive than spermatozoa. The dose-effect relation was linear below 60 ppm . h for the 3 cell types. At higher exposures, sterility prevented mutation detection in spermatocytes and in spermatogonia. The lowest effective exposure for spermatozoa was 18 ppm . h (0.25 ppm for 72 h). In spermatids, the lowest exposure tested, 2.3 ppm . h (0.2 ppm for 11 h) induced 4 times the spontaneous mutation rate. Therefore, using prolonged exposure periods one may be able to detect concentrations in the range of parts per billion. Thus, Drosophila appears suitable as a system for detecting very low concentrations of gaseous mutagens in industrial, agricultural and environmental atmospheres.",

    "input": "High levels of female and male sterility were observed among the hybrids from one of the two reciprocal crosses between a wild strain of D. melanogaster known as pi2 and laboratory strains. The sterility, which is part of a common syndrome called hybrid dysgenesis, was found to be associated with the rudimentary condition of one or both of the ovaries or testes. All other tissues, including those of the reproductive system were normal, as were longevity and mating behavior. The morphological details of the sterility closely mimic the agametic condition occurring when germ cells are destroyed by irradiation or by the maternal-effect mutation, grandchildless. We suggest that sterility in hybrid dysgenesis is also caused by failure in the early development of germ cells. There is a thermo-sensitive period beginning at approximately the time of initiation of mitosis among primordial germ cells a few hours before the egg hatches and ending during the early larval stages. Our results suggest that hybrid dysgenesis, which also includes male recombination, mutation and other traits, may be limited to the germ line, and that each of the primordial germ cells develops, or fails to develop, independently of the others. This hypothesis is consistent with the observed frequencies of unilateral and bilateral sterility, with the shape of the thermosensitivity curves and with the fact that males are less often sterile than females. The features of this intraspecific hybrid sterility are found to resemble those seen in some interspecific Drosophila hybrids, especially those from the cross D. melanogaster X D. simulans.",

In Exp. 1, semen was collected from 8 geldings every other day after castration until the number of spermatozoa per ejaculate was below 1% of the precastration value. An average of 3 ejaculates was required to reduce the number of spermatozoa below this level. In Exp. 2, 15 stallions were castrated and each stallion was assigned to 1 of 3 groups for seminal collection at 7, 14 or 21 days post-castration. The ejaculates collected on these days contained an average of 23, 14 and 2 X 10(6) spermatozoa/ejaculate, respectively. In both experiments, all spermatozoa in ejaculates collected 7 or 8 days after castration were non-motile. Frequency of ejaculation did not appear to hasten the disappearance of spermatozoa from the ejaculates.

    "instruction": "What concentration of penicillin should be included in the glycerol portion of the extender per milliliter?",
    "input": "The following recommendations and conclusions are based upon results of fertility and laboratory studies, and general trends from field investigations. Fertility results due to the addition of enzymes have been variable and contradictory. Flushing of ampules with dry, gaseous nitrogen prior to filling has become a routine practice in processing semen to be frozen. For control of Vibrio fetus and Leptospira pomona, 2,000 micrograms of streptomycin and 1,000 u polymyxin B sulfate should be added per milliliter of raw semen immediately after collection. The extender for initial dilution should contain the same concentration of antibiotics used for raw semen plus 500 u penicillin. The glycerol portion of the extender should contain 500 u penicillin per milliliter. The effect of addition of sugars on fertility has been highly variable. The primary beneficial effect is probably due to their cryoprotective properties. A myriad of concoctions have been added to bovine semen and the results have been highly variable with respect to both motility and fertility. Results of subsequent experiments have rarely proven that addition of exotic compounds or mixtures has been of value. Higher mean fertility was obtained with semen in straws in 14 of 21 comparisons with ampules. The differences in favor of straws ranged from 1.1 to 18.9; while the range in favor of ampules was .1 to 4.4 percentage points. Fertility obtained with pellets has ranged from minus 12.8 to plus 11.9 percentage points in nonreturn rate (NR), compared to the corresponding NR with semen in ampules. Fertility of semen in ampules was higher in five of eight studies. Fertility of pelleted semen has ranged from minus 9.5 to plus 6.0 percentage points compared with straws. Fertility was higher for semen in pellets in only one of five investigations. Pellets should not be used until the potential for pathogenic contamination and exchange of spermatozoa among pellets is eliminated. There is a potential for higher fertility with semen in straws as compared to other packaging systems, but the issue of liquid nitrogen (LN) entry and possible contamination of semen should be further investigated. In general, fertility obtained with semen frozen in the .25 ml straw has been equal to or higher than semen in larger packages. However, they cannot be unequivocally recommended due to other considerations. From laboratory studies, it appears that greater spermatozoan survival is obtained when semen frozen in straws is thawed in water at 35 C or above.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

A positive correlation between the activity of spermatozoa and the fertility ensues from the values of correlation coefficients.

In the other characteristics, i.e. in the production of spermatozoa, volume of gel substance, pH, ergothioneine concentration, polarographic and hemolytic activity, the correlation coefficients were very low. It is assumed that these characteristics may influence the livability and preservation of the sperm, but they do not affect its fertilizing ability.",

The females were superovulated and mated to untreated males at intervals ranging from 0.5 to 14.5 days after treatment. The fertilized ova were collected and cultured to the first cleavage mitosis, at which time the female chromosome complement was analyzed for structural chromosomal damage. Chromatid-type aberrations were observed, but at a much lower frequency than previously reported for treatment of post-meiotic male germ cells. The time after treatment at which chromosomal damage was observed and the frequency of affected cells agree, qualitatively, with existing dominant-lethal data derived from treatment of maturing oocytes. Parallel experiments in which metaphase I oocytes were analyzed indicate a lack of MMS-induced chromosomal damage in the meiotic stages. This observation is consistent with the suggestion that an intervening round of DNA synthesis is necessary for MMS-induced lesions to be translated into chromosomal damage. The low yield of chromosomal damage is consistent with the idea that maturing oocytes, unlike later spermatids and spermatozoa, are capable of performing macromolecular repair of premutational lesions.",

In the human subject, for example, it is estimated that one in every 50 ejaculated spermatozoa is genetically abnormal. The causal basis of these anomalies is poorly understood. Meiotic accidents, environmental mutagens, and gamete senescence in utero are all implicated. However, many of these abnormal cells are fertile. This fact plus the weight of the evidence reviewed suggest that fertility differences among males which cannot be ascribed to measurable differences in semen characteristics reflect, in large part, the increased opportunity of nuclear defective gametes in the semen of some males to effect fertilization. The elimination of embryos arising from eggs fertilized by genetically defective spermatozoa through spontaneous abortions, although biologically costly, must be viewed as the final check for the elimination of genetic detritus of the species.",

Fifteen procedures were done on fourteen patients with severe limitation of movements. The results were gratifying; eight very good and four good. No case was made worse. The technique is described in detail and operative and post-operative complications described. A long-term follow-up study showed that the results tended to improve after several years. The prognosis can be based on the degree of flexion obtained during operation, though free flexion should be distinguished from forced flexion. It is concluded that the procedures used are worthwhile in spite of previous sepsis.",

Fractures between the subtrochanteric and supracondylar region has been considered. 2/3 part of the injured have been victims of traffic accidents, 1/6 part suffering severe polytraumatisation. From among the healed patients in 88 per cent an operation was carried out 76.8 per cent of which were medullary nailing following a broadened indication. In their patients treated surgically the fractures healed within 6 months in 75.4 per cent of cases. It is concluded that in the treatment of femoral shaft fractures the usual operative measures yield fast healing with good function.

    "input": "Administration of three successive doses of triiodothyronine (T3) (50 micrograms/100 g body wt), given on alternate days to thyroidectomized and euthyroid rats, stimulated oxygen consumption (QO2) and Na+ transport-dependent respiration (QO2 [5]) in the stripped jejunal mucosa, a preparation that consisted mostly of epithelial cells. The increase in QO2(t) accounted for 57% of the increment in QO2 in the transition from the hypothyroid to the euthyroid state and for 29% of the increment in the transition from the euthyroid to the hyperthyroid state. Administration of T3 to hypothyroid rats also increased the yield of epithelial cells. Injection of T3 into thyroidectomized and euthyroid rats increased the specific activity (at Vmax) of the (Na+ + K+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (NaK-ATPase) in jejunal crude membrane preparations. No significant change was recorded in the activity of Mg-ATPase in the same preparation. The ratio of QO2/NaK-ATPase and QO2(t)/NaK-ATPase in the various thyroid states remained constant, indicating proportionate increased in the respiratory and enzymatic indices. The effect of administration of T3 to thyroidectomized rats on the number of NaK-ATPase units (recovered in the crude membrane preparation) was estimated by: (a) Na+ + Mg++ + ATP-dependent binding of [3H]-ouabain to crude membrane fractions, and (b) the amount of the phosphorylated intermediate formed in the NaK-ATPase reaction from AT32P(gamma). Estimates were obtained of the maximal number of [3H]ouabain binding sites (Nm) and dissociation constants (Kd). Nm for [3H]ouabain and Nak-ATPase specific activity increased to about the same extent after T3 administration to thyroidectomized rats, with no change in the apparent Kd values. The amount of phosphorylated intermediate formed in jejunal crude membrane preparations also increased significantly. Thus, thyroid hormone administration may increase the number of active Na+pump sites in the plasma membrane. The apparent increase in the number of Na+ pump sites also correlated with the hormone dependent increases in QO2 and QO2(t).",

    "input": "The time course of the effect of bovine TSH (bTSH) on serum concentrations of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) was measured in the normal mouse. The basal, unstimulated levels were 3.2+/-1.1 mug/100 ml T4 and 104+/-25 ng/100 ml T3 (mean+/-SD). With doses of bTSH from 0.5 to 100 mU the peak levels of the thyroid hormones were only 2.6 and 1.8 times the basal level for T4 and T3, respectively. With increasing doses of bTSH there was a proportional prolongation of the increased serum levels of thyroid hormones, i.e., about 2 h for 0.5mU to 12 h for 100 mU TSH. The integrated response with time was linearly related to the log dose. This would suggest a control mechanism which prevents excessive concentration of thyroid hormones in the serum. This pattern of response to TSH differs somewhat from that obtained by following radioiodine release in the McKenzie type bio-assay. To avoid the problems of changing blood concentrations of thyroid hormones and TSH, the release of T4 and T3 from the mouse thyroid was measured in vitro. The secretion increased with bTSH concentrations in the range of 0.02-0.8 mU/ml for T4 and 0.02-0.4 mU/ml for T3. The maximal response was 8.8+/-0.5 ng T4/3h/thyroid and 3.6+/-0.3 ng T3/3h/thyroid as against the basal secretion of 2.4+/-0.2ng T4 and 0.8+/-0.1 ng T3 (mean+/-SEM). Further in crease in bTSH concentration was associated with a decreased rate of thyroid hormone release. Thyroidal cAMP accumulation was enhanced with increasing bTSH concentration, even when there was a decrease in secretion. The dichotomy in the dose-response pattern between the two parameters indicated that the effect of high TSH concentrations on the release was induced at a step beyond cAMP accumulation. This was corroborated by the similar pattern of release induced by increasing concentration of DBcAMP. These findings indicate the existence of an intrathyroidal autoregulatory mechanism which prevents excess increase of thyroid hormone levels in the blood.",

Their weights remained the same as those of control animals, despite an approximately 3-fold increment in plasma L-thyroxine and L-triiodothyronine concentrations. The activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase as well as incorporation of tritium into fatty acids were depressed significantly in epididymal adipose tissue and enhanced significantly in livers of thyroxine-treated rats. Using antibodies specific against rat liver fatty acid synthetase, it was determined that the changes in activity of this multienzymic complex were due to alterations in amount of enzyme protein. In the presence of optimal concentrations of fatty acids, radioactive sn-glycero-3-phosphate, and co-substrates, total glycerolipid synthesis (defined in this study as the sum of newly formed radioactive mono- and diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate, diglyceride, and triglyceride) was decreased significantly in adipose tissue and increased in liver and heart. Thus, administration of thyroid hormone results in tissue-specific alterations in lipid biosynthesis which, at least in the case of fatty acid synthetase, are due to changes in enzyme protein content.",

    "input": "We studied the effect of thyroid hormone administration on responsivity of murine thyroid to exogenous thyrotropin (TSH) in order to explore the possibility that the thyroid gland might be directly inhibited by its own hormones. In the rat both L-thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine (T3) pretreatment inhibited TSH-induced thyroidal ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in vivo in a dose-related manner (half-maximal inhibition, 1.7 mug/rat and 0.6 mug/rat, respectively). Other structurally related compounds exhibited the following inhibitory potencies compared to T4: T3, 283%; triiodothyroacetic acid, 40%; D-T4, 18%; 3,5-L-diiodothyronine, 9%. Monoiodotyrosine, diiodotyrosine, and iodide were not inhibitory. The full inhibitory effect of T4 or T3 was observed when thyroid hormone was administered from 96 to 12 h before TSH and was also seen in hypophysectomized animals. Pretreatment with T4 or T3 in divided doses over 2 1/2 days inhibited TSH-induced increase in [1-14C]glucose oxidation to 14C02 and [3H] leucine incorporation into protein in rat thyroid. In the mouse T4 or T3 pretreatment (0.25-25 mug daily) caused dose-related inhibition of both thyroidal ODC activity and 131I release induced by TSH in vivo. In mice on a low-iodine diet (LID) but not in animals on a regular diet (RD) NaI pretreatment also blunted TSH-induced thyroidal ODC activation and 131I release. When LID or RD mice were pretreated with 12.5-125 mug of T4 or T3 over 2 1/2 days, TSH-induced in vitro stimulation of thyroid cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate formation was inhibited in a dose-related manner; NaI pretreatment was inhibitory in the LID mouse only. Prior administration of exogenous TSH blunted the activation of thyroid ODC and thyroid hormone release induced by subsequent TSH administration in rat and mouse. These studies indicate altered thyroid responsivity to TSH under the influence of circulating thyroid hormones and suggest the existence of a \"short-loop\" negative feedback regulating thyroid function.",
    "output": "The percentage inhibitory potency of triiodothyroacetic acid (TTA) compared to T4 was 40%. This means that TTA was 40% as effective as T4 in inhibiting the thyroidal ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in the mouse thyroid gland."

Sucrose gradient centrifugation analyses showed no observable effects of thyroidectomy or acute induced hyperthyroidism upon receptor levels in uterus hypothalamus of ovariectomized rats, but an apparent positive thyroidal influence upon anterior pituitary receptor content. Qualitatively, the receptor complex sedimentation coefficients were unaltered. Binding assays showed that thyroid hormone administration to the ovariectomized rat resulted in a marked increase in pituitary receptor content, whereas the same treatment had no significant effect on the pituitary receptor level of the intact animal. Conversely, a marked fall in uterine receptor content was found in thyroxine-treated intact, but not castrate, animals. The changes in measurable receptor levels could not be attributed to competition for estrogen binding sites by thyroxine or triiodothyronine. Pituitary receptor content of ovariectomized rats was studied following administration of varying levels of thyroxine; 5 mug/day significantly depressed receptor levels, while enhancement of binding capacity was occasioned by levels of thyroxine ewual to or greather than 25 mug/day. The hypothalamus was completely unaffected by similar treatment and the uterus responded with decreased receptor level only at the highest dosage used. Thyroxine replacement reversed the decrease in anterior pituitary receptor concentration detectable following thyroidectomy.

Evidence for alpha-adrenergic receptor activity was found in rat adipose tissue, but was less marked than the pronounced alpha-adrenergic activity in human adipose tissue. Glycerol release from adipose tissue in response to noradrenaline stimulation was less marked in hypothyroidism in both species, and was related to an increased alpha-adrenergic activity. No evidence was found for increased alpha-adrenergic effects on cyclic AMP level in hypothyroid subjects, and little evidence was found in adipose tissue from hypothyroid rats. This discrepancy may be due to the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline, in the incubation system.

Cultures with confluent cells accumulated cyclic AMP (10-150 times the basal amount) upon addition of bovine thyrotropin (100 milliunits/ml), indicating that the cells in culture maintained a thyrotropin-sensitive adenylate cyclase system. Addition of high doses of thyrotropin also induced a characteristic and reversible change in the morphology of the cells. The effect of thyrotropin on cell growth was studied in short- and long-term experiments. Thyrotropin reduced [(3)H]thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent fashion in all cultures of thyroid cells. The maximal inhibition over a 24-hr period was about 50%. The thyroid cells were notably sensitive, and the half-maximal effect occurred at about 100 milliunits of thyrotropin per ml. In contrast, the hormone had no effect on [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation into human glial cells. Low doses of thyrotropin also had no effect on human fibroblasts and, at high doses, a stimulation of [(3)H]thymidine incorporation was seen. Thyroid cell cultures grown in the presence of 10 milliunits of thyrotropin per ml for 7-14 days had a slower growth rate and 24-36% lower cell numbers at saturation density than control dishes, indicating that the hormone also had a long-term effect on cell proliferation. The data agree with in vitro studies by others of the effects of corticotropin and lutropin on target cells and suggest that in vivo the primary action of pituitary trophic hormones on endocrine tissues is not stimulation of growth.",

Volume flow can be indirectly obtained according to the formula: Q = (phi/4)(diam)2-v. In order to determine the accuracy of this estimate, in vivo direct bleedout measurements were performed on the abdominal aorta of six dogs with an overall accuracy in 77 trials of +2.0 +/- 8.7% (mean +/- 1 SD). The best-fit mean linear regression line was found to be: flowmeter output = 1.013-true flow + 5.1 ml/min. The scatter in the flowmeter's accuracy is thought to be due to small variations in the angle of the transducer. The source of the 2% overestimation in the mean accuracy could not be directly attributed to any one condition; the error is sufficiently small that in many cases it can be neglected.",
    "output": "The formula used to indirectly obtain volume flow in the context is Q = (phi/4)(diam^2-v), where Q is the volume flow, phi is the ultrasonic pulse repetition frequency, diam is the diameter of the vessel, and v is the velocity of blood flow. However, it's important to note that this formula is indirect, and the accuracy of the estimate is +2.0 \u00b1 8.7% as determined by in vivo direct bleedout measurements. The accuracy of the flowmeter is also influenced by the angle of the transducer and small variations in this angle may lead to scatter in the accuracy. The mean overestimation of 2% could not be directly attributed to any one condition."

The results indicate an increase in the flow velocity of the injected as well as the non-injected carotid system. This implies that there are no local constrictions of the carotid artery following intervention and, furthermore, it implies a systematic effect of the puncture and injection itself, or of the contrast medium, on the whole cerebral circulation.

Blood velocity was measured in the same vessel with an intravascular velocity probe and electromagnetic flowmeter. Changes in blood pressure, flow and velocity, were induced by intravenous administration of noradrenaline, angiotensin, isoprenaline and aminophylline. If the velocity probe was within the cuff of the flow probe, percentage changes in flow and velocity were comparable, but if the velocity probe was \"upstream\" or \"downstream\" from the cuff, discrepancies between percentage drug-induced changes in flow and velocity were of the order of 30% and, in 12 out of 80 observations, in opposite directions. Measuring absolute flow with the velocity-sensitive device produced variable results showing a systematic underestimate of flow estimated from velocity, compared with flow measured with the perivascular probe. It is concluded that the measurement of blood flow and changes in blood flow, with the intravascular velocity probe, is liable to produce inaccurate data.",

Various techniques resorting to indicators introduced into the systemic or the coronary circulation are used. Measurement of the coronary blood flow is derived from the pattern of myocardial indicator uptake or washout curves. The currently available techniques for quantitating coronary flow include inert diffusible gases, radioisotopes and continuous thermodilution; each of these has some methodological limitations. Moreover, regulation of coronary circulation depends upon several factors, and quantitative assessment of coronary perfusion in patients with ischemic heart disease has raised appreciable difficulties.

In contrast to the existing techniques of coronary flow measurements, the introduced method has several advantages (it takes into account the total coronary flow, permits high precision and an unlimited number of repeated measurements in a dynamic observation), but it can be employed only in the course of surgical interventions on the heart after the ascending aorta has been separated from the trunk of the pulmonary artery.",

Potential toxicity, the hazard to man represented by most of these chemicals, may be low because the concentration in food may be low. The gap in our knowledge of long-term effects makes rational decisions as to allowable levels of these substances a major problem. On the other hand, nitrosamines and aflatoxins are toxins for which there exists a voluminous literature documentaing extreme biologic activity in experimental animals and indirect evidence for activity in man. Epidemiologic evidence has linked them to human cancers, and because of increasing evidence of long-term human exposure to these toxins either as inadvertent contaminants during food preparation or as the metabolites of mycotic infestation this possible hazard demands intensive investigation.

The time of survival (after infection) and the steroid metabolism are the indicators of some hidden trouble caused by environmental influence.

    "input": "Most chemical contaminants occur in highest concentrations in coastal waters, often maximized in very localized areas. In general, this situation represents the exposure pattern for marine animals. However, the availability of contaminant to an organism depends not only on its concentration but also on its chemical nature, its physical state, and whether the source of exposure is the surrounding seawater or the diet. Depending on the type of exposure, uptake occurs across absorptive surfaces, such as those of the respiratory apparatus or gastrointestinal tract, where selectivity may occur, even among neighboring homologs. Deposition in tissues, accumulation, degradation, or depuration depends on tissue type, metabolic processes, detoxification mechanisms, and the adaptive status of a particular animal. This hypothesis is examined briefly for hydrocarbons, pesticides, other miscellaneous organic contaminants, heavy metals, and radionuclides. It is concluded that most data relate to occurrence and distribution. Considerably less information is available on the underlying biochemical processes.",

The minimal concentration of formaldehyde that can be detected by odor is similar to the level that produces minimal irritant effects on the eyes and in the pulmonary airway, thereby serving as a warning of exposure to the compound. The irritant effects are reversible when exposure is discontinued. Some persons show allergic type responses to concentrations of the compound that are well below the odor threshold.

Too little is known about the chemical composition of polluted atmospheres and other environments, and the situation will worsen as a result of the steadily increasing production of a wide variety of chemicals. This and other evidence presented in this paper indicates that the human race has not yet felt the full impact of the burgeoning chemical environment in terms of genotoxic effects. Some highly suggestive data from the literature have been presented to indicate that carcinogenesis and mutagenesis in human beings involve not only the attack of a primary genotoxicant, but that genetic factors, cofactors, antifactors and sometimes precursors can play important roles in the process of genotoxicity. Evidence has been presented to indicate that genotoxic effects are much more prevalent among human beings than is commonly believed. Since inherited effects arise from mutation of a germ cell, cancer probably from mutation of a somatic cell, atherosclerosis possibly from some mutagenic effect and the debilitating effects of some aspects of ageing possibly from a somatic mutation of the metabolic type, then mutagenesis in these four postulated types could be the overwhelmingly major cause of death in modern society.",

Epidemiological surveys made in road tunnel employees and in traffic officers have not demonstrated specific effects and have often been complicated by cigarette smoking as a factor. Long-term animal experiments run mostly on small rodents give evidence of little effect of the pathological actions of dilutions such as those encountered in high polluted cities. However the acute toxicity of gasoline exhaust emission is well known and mostly due to carbon monoxide. Considering the different types of cycles and operating conditions of vehicles (gasoline and diesel), auto exhaust gases constitute no more a chemical entity than they show, a definite toxicity. A great number of substances that they contain (nitrogen oxides, aldehydes, antiknock additives, heavy metals, possible catalysts are highly toxic as shown by in vivo and in vitro (mutagenic) tests. Interactions of the components are for the moment ignored or poorly understood. Besides, the evolution of the physicochemical properties and natures of the auto exhaust emission in the gaseous biotope of man under determined conditions of ultraviolet irradiation, temperature, and hygrometry provoke the formation of secondary products such as oxidants and ozone. Several experiments show clearly that irradiation increases the toxicity of auto exhaust significantly. For these reasons, geographical, meteorological, and chronological (circadian and seasonal) factors should be taken into consideration, especially with regard to emission standards.",

    "instruction": "What is an example of a substance where animal experiments may not lead to conclusions that apply to humans?",
    "input": "All substances are toxic when the dose is large enough. In order to regulate the use of chemicals, we need to measure the level at which toxic effects are found. Epidemiological evidence suggests that present levels of chemical use do not lead to widespread harmful contamination of the human environment. For chemicals, most of the problems of toxicity are found in the workplace, while the population at large gets most of its toxic effects from voluntary exposure to substances such as tobacco smoke and ethanol. The prevention and control of toxic effects depends on a series of steps. This begins with measurement of toxicity in model systems, such as laboratory animals, and the estimation of the likely exposure of workers or consumers. Reliable extrapolation of information gathered from animals to the diverse and biochemically differing human population depends on understanding mechanisms of toxic effects. The toxic effect and mechanisms of action of substances such as carbon tetrachloride or paracetamol have been extensively investigated, and our ability to predict toxicity or develop antidotes to poisoning has had some success, but epidemiology is still an essential part of assessment of toxic effects of new chemicals. The example of phenobarbitone shows how animal experiments may well lead to conclusions which do not apply to man. After measurement of toxicity and assessment of likely hazards in use comes the final evaluation of the use of a chemical. This depends not only on its toxicity, but also on its usefulness. The direct effects on health may be small in comparison with the indirect advantageous effects which a useful substance such as vinyl chloride may bring. The assessment of risks and benefits of new chemicals can be partly removed from a political style of discourse, but the evaluation of the relative weight to be attached to these risks and benefits is inescapably political. The scientific contribution must be to allow the debate to take place in the light of maximum clarity of information about the consequences of use of chemicals.",
    "output": "An example of a substance where animal experiments may not lead to conclusions that apply to humans is phenobarbitone. This is because the toxic effects and mechanisms of action of substances can vary significantly between different species, and the response to a chemical can be influenced by a variety of factors such as genetics, diet, and lifestyle. Therefore, while animal experiments can provide valuable information about the potential toxicity of a substance, they may not always accurately predict the effects in humans."

The patients were grouped by age and, in some aspects, were compared with a small control group of their siblings. The patient group had a lowered incidence of plaque and less gingival disease than did the control group in which every person had some amount of plaque or gingival disease. Calculus formation was minimal. The reasons for the finding of minimal plaque in the patient group could be related to several factors, including the life-long use of various antibiotic agents, the chewing of digestive enzyme supplements, the effect of medical management on tooth hardness, and the effect of stained teeth (possible tetracycline deposition) on the plaque microorganisms. It appears that the therapy for cystic fibrosis was beneficial to the periodontal health of these patients. Much further study is needed to understand the interrelationship between an altered oral environment (salivary changes in cystic fibrosis), altered microbial flora (by antibiotics, enzymes) and even altered tooth surfaces (possible tetracycline deposition). Most patients were found to have one or more oral habits. Tooth mobility was associated with tension habits.

    "input": "Twenty dental students randomly divided into four groups of five participated in this trial. Three weeks of supervised oral hygiene preceded the study in order to ensure a optimum state of gingival health. The gingival condition was assessed by means of the Gingival Index and measurements of gingival exudate. Plaque accumulation was assessed by means of the Plaque Index. Using plaque-guards, two 21-day periods were alllowed for the induction of localized experimental gingivitis around a lateral incisor and adjacent canine in each jaw. The contralateral areas served as controls. Habitual oral hygiene procedures were maintained in all other areas of the mouth throughout the experimental periods. Following 21 days of localized plaque accumulation in the mandibular experimental areas, mechanical toothcleaning procedures were introduced at intervals of once a day (Group A), once every second day (Group B), once every third day (Group C) and once every fourth day (Group D). Groups A and B regained gingival health in 10 days. The experiment was then repeated in the maxillary experimental areas. Group A, rinsing once daily with chlorhexidine solution regained gingival health in 4 days. The results obtained in the localized experimental gingivitis model were similar to those reported when totally withdrawing oral hygiene.",

Without advance notice, plaque deposits were scored, using the Plaque Index System, and gingival health was determined using the criteria of the Gingival Index System. The 1st-year students had the poorest hygiene and gingival health. An improvement (P less than 0.01) was noted in the 2nd-year students who were still not in clinical training but had completed a course in preventive dentistry including oral hygiene techniques. Further improvement (P less than 0.05) was found in students participating in the clinical courses (3rd and 4th years). However, some deterioration of both hygiene and gingival status occurred in the senior 5th year. Among the faculty, the best oral hygiene and gingival state were found in members of departments in which clinical work centered around patient motivation toward prevention and tooth conservation. The scores for plaque and gingivitis were worse in the departments of oral surgery, dental materials, orthodontics and the basic science departments. Almost all departments and every class showed a few individuals with very poor oral hygiene. It is suggested that regular patient contact influences the personal attitude toward oral hygiene, and that professional activity and emphasis on different aspects of the curriculum may be reflected in the attitude of health professionals toward oral health.",

The relative probabilities of these events, and the amout of energy transferred, can be calculated from basic physical theory. The microscopic damage caused in a particular specimen in given operating conditions is more difficult to predict, but it can be measured by a number of macroscopic indicators, the chief of which are loss of mass and changes in the energy loss spectrum (or electron diffraction, pattern, if any). For most biological material the observed rate of damage is such as to set a limit to the intensity of illumination, the maximum magnification and the minimum size of detail that can be made visible. Several techniques have been devised and tested for reducing the radiation sensitivity of a specimen, of which cooling to a very low temperature and encasing it in an inert medium are the most effective. If the various protective measures act cooperatively, they could increase the effective resolution of sensitive material by an order of magnitude, making possible electron microscopy of the atomic structure of, for instance, the nucleic acid bases and other macromolecules. The prospects for observing living cells at a resolution better than that of the best optical microscopes would remain very small.",

Binding was not affected by alterations in pH in the range of pH 6.5 to 8.5, by ionic strength, or by the presence of Mg2+. Loss of the delta subunit from the enzyme had no effect on binding. However, removal of the delta and epsilon subunits by treatment of the enzyme with trypsin prevented binding to phospholipid. This treatment also removed a small portion (less than 2000 daltons) of the alpha subunit. It is concluded that the ATPase of E. coli binds to phospholipid vesicles mainly by nonpolar interactions through the alpha and (or) epilson subunits of the enzyme.",

A series of partly reassembled complexes, varying only in their E1 (pyruvate decarboxylase, EC 1.2.4.1) content, was incubated with pyruvate in the absence of CoA, conditions under which the lipoic acid residues covalently bound to the E2 (lipoate acetyltransferase, EC2.3.1.12) chains of the complex become reductively acetylated, and the reaction then ceases. The fraction of E2 chains thus acetylated was estimated by specific reaction of the thiol groups in the acetyl-lipoic acid moieties with N-ethyl[2,3-14C]maleimide. The simplest interpretation of the results was that a single E1 dimer is capable of catalysing the rapid acetylation of 8-12 E2 chains, in good agreement with the results of Bates, Danson, Hale, Hooper & Perham [(1977) Nature (London) 268, 313-316]. This novel functional connexion of active sites must be brought about by transacetylation reactions between lipoic acid residues of neighbouring E2 chains in the enzyme complex. There was also a slow transacylation process between the rapidly acetylated lipoic acid residues and those that did not react in the initial, faster phase. This interaction was not investigated in detail, since it is too slow to be of kinetic significance in the normal enzymic reaction.",

This number is part of the Enzyme Commission (EC) numbering system, which classifies enzymes based on their catalytic function.

Peptide uptake was apparently not regulated and proceeded continuously until complete, with the absorbed peptides undergoing rapid intracellular hydrolysis and the excess amino acid residues leaving the cell. Thus, peptide uptake and amino acid exodus occur concurrently. However, peptidase-resistant substrates, e.g. triornithine and glycylsarcosine, which can be similarly estimated in cell extracts, were accumulated about 1,000-fold. The influence of amino acid composition and chain length on rates of transport was assessed. Different strains of E. coli showed variability in their rates of di- and oligopeptide transport. With respect to energy coupling, both the di- and oligopeptide permeases behaved like shock-sensitive transport systems.",

One partial revertant showed a slight increase in active transport and a slight decrease in proton permeability. 5. The other partial revertant showed a large increase in transport ability and a large decrease in proton permeability. 6.

This suggests that the addition of N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or the crude soluble ATPase of the wild type restores the energy state of the membrane in these strains, possibly by influencing the conformation of the Mg-2+-ATPase, which is proposed to be important in the utilization of energy derived from the electron transport chain and is independent of the catalytic activity of the Mg-2+-ATPase.

Aggregation is extremely persistent: alkali, sodium dodecyl sulphate/urea, guanidinium . HCl and carboxymethylation reduce it, but do not eliminate it completely. 3. Nevertheless, results of indirect immunoprecipitation tests suggest that antigenic determinants of cytochrome c oxidase are among the products synthesized. The immunoprecipitation appears specific by criteria including competition experiments and its absence when mtDNA from low complexity petites, retaining only the gene for 21 S rRNA and some flanking sequences, is used to programme protein synthesis. Electrophoretic analysis of material precipitated by anti-cytochrome c oxidase sera reveals four discrete polypeptides with molecular weights of 7400, 6400, 5000 and 4100, which probably represent polypeptide fragments carrying antigenic determinants of cytochrome c oxidase.",
    "output": "The molecular weight range of the products of synthesis in the cell-free system derived from Escherichia coli is approximately between 4100 and 7400. This is inferred from the four discrete polypeptides with molecular weights of 7400, 6400, 5000, and 4100 that were observed in the electrophoretic analysis of the material precipitated by anti-cytochrome c oxidase sera."

    "instruction": "What should be done before considering surgical retreatment for recurrence of periodontal disease?",
    "input": "Periodontal disease has a greater or lesser tendency to recur. The therapist controls rather than cures the condition. Careful maintenance is as important as skillful original treatment if periodontal health is to be maintained. At the time of the original treatment, every patient should be informed that retreatment of some type is occasionally necessary. Patients with recurrence of disease should be treated as conservatively as possible and every effort should be made to find the cause of failure. Surgical retreatment should be done only after a reasonable effort has been made to improve the situation by other means. The deepened crevice that does not bleed when probed and is not accompanied by bone loss does not provide justification for surgical retreatment. This report has reviewed some of the reasons for treatment failures and has presented a philosophy for their management.",
    "output": "Before considering surgical retreatment for recurrence of periodontal disease, it's essential to make a reasonable effort to improve the situation by other means. This may involve adjusting the patient's oral hygiene routine, modifying any contributing factors such as smoking or diabetes, and administering antibiotics or scaling and root planing (SRP) procedures. If the deepened crevice does not bleed when probed and is not accompanied by bone loss, surgical retreatment may not be justified. However, if the condition persists despite these conservative measures, then surgical retreatment could be considered. It's crucial to find the cause of failure to ensure the best possible outcome for the patient."

    "input": "In this article a few of the more recently emphasized and pertinent conditions that may affect the hard and soft palate have been discussed. The purpose of the article is not to present in all-inclusive classification of lesions occurring the palate. Disease of the palate may be local in nature or may reflect a systemic condition. Dentists must be conscious of the palate as the site of many possible pathoses. The prosthodontist in particular must observe and carefully evaluate the palate and insure its good health before he can prescribe a prosthesis to cover it. Dentistry provides a health service which affects the entire human organism and not just the oral cavity. Therefore an understanding of the varied nature of pathosis as it relates to the oral cavity, and especially the palate, is essential. Continuous surveillance of the palatal regions insures that the dentist's obligation to detect oral abnormalities in patients is in large measure fulfilled.",
    "output": "A prosthodontist must observe and carefully evaluate the palate to ensure its good health before prescribing a prosthesis. This is because the palate, like other parts of the oral cavity, can be affected by various pathoses, and a prosthesis may be required to cover it. As a health service that affects the entire human organism, it's crucial for dentists, particularly prosthodontists, to have a comprehensive understanding of oral pathologies, especially those related to the palate.

Therefore, anamnestic data seem to be most important in order to uncover the hazard patient (diabetes, survived heart attacks, anticoagulation, rheumatic heart affections, hypertonics, allergies). Local anesthesia can be another problem, because it may lead to collapse (psychogenous or from anaphylactic shock). Focal infection, although in general overrated in its importance for the general organism, may pose some problems before heart surgery and antibiotic therapy previously may seem necessary. Finally, therapeutic consequences from emergencies in the dental office are reviewed.",
    "output": "The type of shock that can potentially cause collapse as a result of local anesthesia is anaphylactic shock. This is an allergic reaction that can be triggered by certain components of the anesthetic solution. However, it's important to note that this is a rare occurrence. Psychogenic collapse, which is a fainting or loss of consciousness due to extreme fear or anxiety, can also occur in some cases. The context suggests that older patients with internal medical diseases may be more susceptible to these complications, so it's crucial to have a thorough understanding of the patient's medical history before administering local anesthesia."

    "input": "The important role played by restorations and prostheses in the accumulation of plaque necessitates careful design of all contours to enable proper removal of plaque by the patient. Early diagnosis of impacted teeth is essential as well as careful design of gingival flaps preserving the maximum of attached gingiva where their removal or exposure is planned. Difficulties arising from closed bite and orthordontic treatment, the need for careful consideration to the importance of endodontic therapy, and removable partial dentures in relation to the health of periodontium, are discussed.",
    "output": "The importance of careful design of gingival flaps in relation to impacted teeth lies in the preservation of the attached gingiva. This is crucial as the attached gingiva provides support and stability to the teeth, as well as aids in plaque control. When impacted teeth require restoration or exposure, careful design of the gingival flaps ensures that the maximum amount of attached gingiva is preserved, maintaining the health and stability of the surrounding teeth and periodontium. This is particularly important considering the role of restorations, prostheses, endodontic therapy, orthodontic treatment, and removable partial dentures in the accumulation of plaque. Therefore, the design of gingival flaps plays a significant role in the overall oral health and treatment outcomes for impacted teeth."

Preservation of the integrity of the dental arch: When there is a need to maintain or restore the natural alignment and balance of the teeth in the dental arch.\n\n2. Biomechanical factors: When the movement of teeth for orthodontic treatment is influenced by the presence of prostheses such as bridges, dentures, or implants.\n\n3. Limitations in the design of prostheses: When the positioning of teeth is crucial for the successful fabrication and function of dental prostheses, such as bridges, crowns, or implants.\n\n4. Esthetic appearance: When the alignment and positioning of teeth are essential for achieving an aesthetically pleasing smile.\n\n5. Periodontal considerations: When there are issues related to periodontal health that could affect the success of orthodontic or prosthodontic treatment.\n\n6. Prevention of malocclusion: When there is a risk of developing malocclusion (misalignment of teeth) due to missing teeth, extraction of teeth, or other factors.\n\n7.

The effect of lipolytic, glycolytic and proteolytic enzymes on the activities of plasma membrane enzyme activities in rat liver and kidney has been investigated by a pretreatment of tissue sections with the lytic enzymes. 2. The action of the proteolytic enzymes causes a very strong decrease of leucyl-beta-naphthylamidase activity, whereas the activities of ATP-ase, 5'-nucleotidase and alkaline phosphatase show a lesser decrease. This indicates a different membrane anchorage of leucyl-beta-naphthylamidase as compared to that of the phosphatases. 3. Treatment with glycolytic enzymes results in a decrease of 5'-nucleotidase and ATP-ase activity, whereas liver alkaline phosphatase and leucyl-beta-naphthylamidase show an increase in activity. 4. Treatment with phospholipase C gives about the same results. The very strong decrease of 5'-nucleotidase activity indicates a great dependence on phospholipids.",
    "output": "Treatment with glycolytic enzymes has an opposite effect on the activity of leucyl-beta-naphthylamidase compared to proteolytic enzymes. While proteolytic enzymes cause a decrease in leucyl-beta-naphthylamidase activity, glycolytic enzymes increase its activity in rat liver and kidney. This difference suggests distinct membrane anchorage for leucyl-beta-naphthylamidase compared to the phosphatases. However, it's important to note that glycolytic enzymes decrease the activities of 5'-nucleotidase and ATP-ase, while liver alkaline phosphatase remains unaffected in this context."

The enzymes show a higher activity in the gray matter than in the white matter. The results are interpreted on the assumption that glyco-lipoprotein turnover is higher in the gray matter than in the white matter, since myelin, which is the major component of the white matter, is a relatively stable structures.",

In patients with tumours, decreased activity of beta-galactosidase was found in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and in patients with multiple sclerosis and collagen diseases, decreased activities of beta-galactosidase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase were found in cerebrospinal fluid. The variations of enzyme activities were great between the individual patients even with these groups and analysis of lysosomal enzymes seems to have a very poor clinical value.",

The two major regions of the gastric mucosa, whose cell populations are comparable in type but have very distinct functions, also differ in many properties of their lysosomal enzymes. These differences necessitate several major modification in their method of assay. Using optimal conditions, the activities of most of these enzymes were found to differ: levels in the antrum, in spite of its high water and mucin-glycoprotein content, were significantly greater, suggesting that the high lysosomal hydrolytic activity may be associated with the rapid autophagic processes of normal turnover of its surface epithelial and mucous neck cells. Lysosomal membrane stability or latency is also greater in the antrum; this may account, in part at least, for antral resistance to erosions brought about by stress.",
    "output": "The high lysosomal hydrolytic activity in the antrum is suggested to be associated with the rapid autophagic processes of normal turnover of its surface epithelial and mucous neck cells. This is due to the higher levels of lysosomal enzymes in the antrum compared to the fundic mucosa, despite the antrum having a higher water and mucin-glycoprotein content. Additionally, the lysosomal membrane stability or latency is greater in the antrum, which may contribute to the antrum's resistance to erosions brought about by stress."

Histological structure of the tumors studied showed that they belonged mainly to highly differentiated hepatocellular adenomas. Liver tissue of the animals which were not treated with DENA, was used as a control. The hexokinase activity was increased about 2-fold in the rat hepatomas and 3-fold--in the mice hepatomas. In primary hepatomas the glucokinase activity was unaltered or slightly decreased; the fructokinase activity was distinctly decreased (in several cases down to zero). The activity of key enzymes of gluconeogenesis--glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-diphosphatase--was distinctly decreased, especially the activity of the former enzyme, which constituted in hepatomas about 1/6 of the activity found in liver tissue.",

With the single exception of Morris hepatoma 16, which had unusually high glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, the activities of glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glycerol kinase were highly correlated in normal livers and hepatomas (r = 0.97; P less than 0.01). The activities of these two enzymes were not strongly correlated with the activities of any of the other three enzymes. The primary function of hepatic glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase appears to be in gluconeogenesis from glycerol.",

Enzymes included were: dehydrogenases of glucose-6-phosphate, lactate, succinate, malate, and alpha-glycerophosphate; peroxidase (catalase); glucose-6-phosphatase; alkaline and acid phosphatase; Mg2+ ATPase; 5'-nucleotidase; and aminopeptidase. Levels of enzyme activity were estimated visually and scored from 0 (not detectable) to a maximum of 5 (intense). Comparison of estimated activity for each enzyme was made between small neoplastic nodules (stage III tumors) and large adenocarcinomas (stage IV tumors) and between tumors and portions of normal proximal tubules in parenchyma of kidneys from untreated control rats. The results, which revealed nearly identical levels of activity for most enzymes in both stages III and IV tumors, suggested similar metabolic and biologic behavior of these lesions. However, when data for tumors were compared with data for normal proximal tubules, striking differences were observed consistent with: 1) a marked shift of energy metabolism from oxidative to glycolytic production of ATP, with a corresponding reduction in mitochondrial respiration; and 2) simplification of plasma membrane specializations that were possibly associated with a reduction or loss of transport function. These findings were compared with other histochemical, biochemical, and ultrastructural studies of renal adenocarcinomas in rats and man.",

Alanine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, and glycyl-proline aminopeptidases and esterase showed relatively high activities in all these organs and cells. In the kidney homogenate the aminopeptidase A activity was higher in other organs; i.e., the aminopeptidase A activity was lower than that of aminopeptidase B. Normal cells derived from kidneys showed the kidney-type pattern of amino-peptidases A and B on the surface of cells, whereas tumor cells from various origins were of another organ type. When cultured mouse fibroblast strain C3H2K and rat fibroblast strain 3Y1 cells were transformed by SV40 or by a ts A mutant and maintained at permissive temperature, aminopeptidase A activity was drastically decreased, and the ratio of aminopeptidase A to aminopeptidase B was reduced to the levels of tumor cells. If the ts A mutant-transformed cells were grown at the restrictive temperature, the ratio approached that of normal cells. In normal cells, however, cultivation at high or low temperature did not cause any change of the activities.",

The specific activity of the beta-glucosidase in the high speed supernatant (100 000 X g, 90 min) fraction of rat kidney homogenate is 700-fold greater than that in the same fraction from heart, skeletal muscle, lung, spleen, brain or liver. beta-Glucosidase activity co-chromatographs with beta-D-galactosidase, beta-D-fucosidase, alpha-L-arabinosidase and beta-D-xylosidase activities through the last four column steps of the purification and their specific activities are 0.26, 0.39, 0.028 and 0.017 relative to that of beta-glucosidase, respectively. The specific activity of the apparently homogeneous beta-glucosidase is 115 000 nmol of glucose released from 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside per mg protein per h. All five glycosidase activities possess similar pH dependency (pH optimum, 6--7) and heat lability, and co-migrate on polyacrylamide disc gels at pH 8.9 (RF, 0.67). beta-Glucosidase acitivity is inhibited competitively by glucono-(1 leads to 5)-lactone (KI, 0.61 mM) and non-competitively by a variety of sulfhydryl reagents including N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and iodoacetic acid. Although the enzyme will release glucose from p-nitrophenyl and 4-methylumbelliferyl derivatives of beta-D-glucose, it will not hydrolyze xylosyl-O-serine, beta-D-glucocerebroside, lactose, galactosylovalbumin or trehalose. The enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 50 000--58 000, has a sedimentation coefficient of 4.41 S and contains a relatively large number of acidic amino acids. A study of the distribution of beta-glucosidase activity in various regions of the dissected rat kidney indicates that the enzyme is probably contained in cells of the proximal convoluted tubule.

In our studies we establish statistically significant differences in neurological and psychiatric abnormalities and mental deterioration in patients below and above age 35, indicating progressive changes in the central nervous system. We demonstrate higher incidence of recent memory loss, impairment of short-term visual retention, frontal release signs, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, long-tract signs, and psychiatric problems. We also note the presence of external features of precocious aging. Down's syndrome appears to be a human chromosomal abnormality in which genetically determined biochemical defects leading to precocious aging and dementia can be studied.",

At birth, means for both length and weight were reduced by about 0.5 SDs from the control group means. By 36 months, mean recumbent length was greater than 2 SDs below that for the control group, while the mean for weight was reduced by about 1.5 SDs from the control group mean. Growth velocity for both length and weight was most deficient within the first two years of life. About 30% of the sample demonstrated excess weight for length relations by 36 months. Children with moderate or severe heart disease were significantly smaller than those without or with mild cardiac problems at all times after birth. Measurements of a subsample of children at 4, 5, and 6 years of age suggested that growth velocity after 3 years of age may be within the range of normal. Assessment of growth of the child with Down's syndrome may be carried out with reference to charts plotting tenth to 90th percentiles based on these data.",

The test scores obtained by the 17 children with Down's syndrome were compared with those of the remaining 20 children (\"others); a cross-sectional examination of the effects of increasing chronological age was made; and an assessment of speech intelligibility was compared with language scale scores. The results show that the children as a group had a language deficit compared with their non-verbal ability, and that their verbal comprehension tended to be poorer than their expressive language ability. Children with Down's syndrome tended to have inferior language ability through the differences between their scores and those of the \"others\" were not statistically significant. An association between poor intelligibility of speech and low expressive language scores was demonstrated. The results are discussed in the context of other studies. Possible reasons for the patterns of language development observed are suggested, and the practical implications, particularly the need for careful attention to the language development of severely subnormal children from an early age, are considered.",

In subjects with IH with normal iron stores, plasma iron increased with the addition of 22.5 mg/day.

This method gives results which correlate significantly with other methods which evaluate the iron storage pool, in normal or iron-deficient patients. In some cases, an excess of serum ferritin, contrasting with normal serum iron, is confirmed by cytochemical and/or Fe-kinetic studies. In myeloproliferative diseases however, secretion of ferritin by immature cells may induce an excess of serum ferritin. In such cases, the dosage of ferritinaemia cannot be considered as an index of the iron storage pool. Future development of specific dosage of isoferritins could enable to measure the true iron stores, as well as to give an index estimating the evolution of the abnormal cell population.",
    "output": "Future development of specific dosages of isoferritins could potentially allow for a more accurate measurement of true iron stores in the body. This is because isoferritins are specific forms of ferritin, a protein that stores iron, and developing specific dosages could help differentiate between normal and abnormal cells that secrete ferritin. Additionally, this could provide an index to estimate the evolution of abnormal cell populations, which is particularly useful in haematological diseases. However, it's important to note that this is a potential application and the actual effectiveness and feasibility of such a development would need to be demonstrated through further research."

Plasma for LH and FSH determinations was collected on day 26, 5 h after an injection of progesterone. Massive gonadotropin surges were found after priming with estradiol benzoate or treatment with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), delta 4-androstenedione, and testosterone, but not with ring A-reduced androgens (5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, 5 alpha-androstane-3 alpha,17 beta-diol, its 3 beta-epimer, and androsterone) or the nonaromatizable 11 beta-hydroxy- and 11-ketoderivatives of delta 4-androstenedione. Rats bearing DHEA-containing Silastic implants also produced LH surges in response to progesterone. A single injection of an antiestrogen antiserum abolished gonadotropin surges in rats primed with estradiol benzoate or DHEA and greatly reduced the accompanying uterine hypertrophy. DHEA and delta 4-androstenedione were barely uterotrophic in ovariectomized rats but sustained progesterone-induced gonadotropin surges. The results indicate that certain (adrenal?) androgens are able to induce maturation of the steroid-sensitive surge system via extragonadal aromatization, whereas their uterotrophic effect is largely mediated by the ovaries. Coordinated increased conversion of androgens at central and peripheral sites may be of physiological importance for the triggering of puberty.",
    "output": "The gonadotropin surges in rats primed with estradiol benzoate or DHEA were abolished after a single injection of an antiestrogen antiserum. This suggests that estrogen plays a crucial role in the initiation of these surges. The uterine hypertrophy, which is often associated with these surges, was also greatly reduced. This implies that the uterotrophic effect of these androgens (DHEA and delta 4-androstenedione) is largely mediated by the ovaries, but they can also induce maturation of the steroid-sensitive surge system via extragonadal aromatization.

In the uterus, inhibition of the full effect of estradiol on progestin binding was observed after 3 days of injection of antiestrogen and estradiol. In the absence of estradiol, the antiestrogen produced a slight induction of progestin receptors in the HPOA and pituitary and a substantial induction of progestin receptors in the uterus. The results suggest that the induction of progestin receptors could be a key intermediate step in some behavioral and neuroendocrine actions of estradiol.",

    "input": "Estradiol-17beta administration to young (10- to 12-week-old) rabbits to produce the \"estrogen-dominated\" uterus increased the uterine contractile response to both oxytocin and methacholine in vitro. In \"progesterone-dominated\" uteri, obtained from rabbits that received progesterone for 4 days after estrogen pretreatment, the contractile response to oxytocin in vitro was selectively abolished; the response to methacholine was unaffected. Parallel changes were observed in the concentration (but not affinity) of specific sites in uterine microsomal membranes that bind [(3)H]oxytocin with selectivity features expected for oxytocin receptors. Thus, estrogen-dominated uteri have an increased number of specific [(3)H]oxytocin binding sites per mg of membrane protein relative to untreated controls, whereas specific oxytocin binding sites are reduced to barely detectable levels in the progesterone-dominated uterus. Similar results are obtained when binding sites are measured in membranes from the myometrium of estrogen- or progesterone-dominated uteri. Short-term (24-hr) progesterone administration to estrogen-pretreated rabbits decreased, but did not abolish, specific [(3)H]oxytocin binding; the concentration of specific [(3)H]oxytocin binding sites was reduced without influence on the affinity of these sites. A sublethal dose of actinomycin D, administered over a 24-hr period to rabbits pretreated with estradiol for 4 days, likewise reduced specific oxytocin binding; additive effects were not observed when progesterone and actinomycin D were administered together. These results suggest that the regulatory effects of estrogens and progesterone upon the rabbit uterine contractile response to oxytocin are achieved, at least in part, by the opposing actions of these steroids in regulating the number of oxytocin receptors in smooth muscle cells. Estradiol increased the concentration of uterine oxytocin receptors; the maintenance of high receptor levels appears to depend upon the continuous de novo synthesis of oxytocin receptors. In contrast, progesterone, like actinomycin D, appears to act at the nuclear locus to repress synthesis of oxytocin receptors.",
    "output": "Short-term progesterone administration in estrogen-pretreated rabbits selectively decreased the concentration of specific oxytocin binding sites in uterine microsomal membranes, without affecting their affinity.

There was an increase of the lutropin content in the adenohypophysis and of luliberin in the hypothalamus. Combined with TSP administration of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, p-chlorphenylalanine or droperidol promoted preservation of cyclic changes in the hypothalamic gonadotropin activity and partially prevented disturbances of estradiol and progesteron secretion caused by neonatal androgenization. The mechanisms of participation of biogenic monoamines in sex differentiation of the hypothalamus are discussed.",

The amount of uterine peroxidase seen at 20 hr after a single dose increases with dose from 0.1 to 100 microgram of estradiol. Estrone and estriol also show dose-dependent induction of peroxidase, and the quantitative peroxidase responses to these steroids follow their uterotropic capacities. The antiestrogen CI628, capable of low levels of enzyme induction by itself, can inhibit the induction due to estrogen.

    "input": "The rat ovary during the 1st postnatal week is unresponsive to luteinizing hormone (LH), but responds to prostaglandin E1 with increase of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate synthesis. In the present experiments unresponsiveness of ovaries of 6-day-old rats to LH in synthesis of cAMP was effectively reversed by injection of depot estradiol and diethylstilbestrol on the 2nd and 4th postnatal day. Administration of testosterone, progesterone, deoxycorticosterone, pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin and human chronic gonadotropin had no stimulatory effect. The lack of response to LH also failed to be reversed when estradiol was injected 21 h before killing of the animals or the ovaries were preincubated with estradiol. These results suggest that the development of an ovarian cell system responsive to LH in newborn rat may be accelerated by long-term action of estradiol.",

On the other hand, anti-HBe was found in 4.2% of acute hepatitis, 18.9% of chronic hepatitis, 9.1% of liver cirrhosis, and 12.8% of hepatocellular carcinoma. We found that an early detection of HBeAg in patients with acute hepatitis is of no prognostic value, but its persistence may provide the earliest evidence of potential chronicity. In chronic liver diseases, HBeAg-positive cases showed remarkable fluctuations of serum transaminase levels, severe histological changes and poor responses to treatment. Many of the HBeAg-positive patients lost their initial positivity of HBeAg within six months or one year and in some cases serocoverted to anti-HBe after acute exacerbation. Follow-up study more than several years revealed that the presence of anti-HBe reflect an inactive stage and a more favorable outcome, whereas persistence of HBeAg may provide an active and continuing hepatocellular damage.

The frequency was higher in other population groups in proportion to the intensity of contract with individuals or material positive for HBsAg. Data obtained during an outbreak of type-B hepatitis indicate that immunity to the disease is directly dependent on the titre of circulating HBsAb. A close relationship was found between the presence of HBsAb and liver dysfunction in carriers of HBsAg. This supports the hypothesis that immune response to the antigen may be necessary for the development of liver damage in type-B hepatitis. Nevertheless, since a good antibody response to HBsAg was found in uraemic patients, in whom hepatitis had a clinical course quite different from the population at large, it is thought that immune mechanisms other than the humoral response may account for the pathogenesis of the disease.",

Of the 60 HBsAg-positive livers, 51 were diagnosed as chronic hepatitis on histological grounds, 6 as acute hepatitis, and 3 as \"near-normal liver.\" From the 60 tissue-positive cases, 3 subjects were HBsAg seronegative. HBcAg was detected in 44 livers, all of which also had HBcAg in the localized in the cytoplasm and the membranes of the hepatocytes, and HBcAg in the nuclei and in 4 cases also in the cytoplasm. Predominant HBsAg expression in the cytoplasm was observed in near-normal liver, chronic persistent hepatitis, and cirrhosis with little activity. This correlated with the amount of ground glass hepatocytes in the biopsies. HBcAg and membrane-localized HBsAg were minimal in those conditions. HBcAg was most prevalent in patients with chronic aggressive hepatitis and active cirrhosis treated with immunosuppressive drugs, whereas the amounts of HBsAg and HBcAg in nontreated patients of those two groups and in acute hepatitis with signs of transition to chronicity were almost equal. HBsAg expression in liver cell membranes was most prominent in active forms of chronic hepatitis (chronic aggressive hepatitis and in active cirrhosis) and in acute hepatitis with signs of transition to chronicity. This observation correlated in the presence of HBcAg in the biopsies of those patients. In acute hepatitis both HBsAg and HBcAg were detected rarely and no membrane expression of HBsAg was observed. The over-all results show a significant relationship between the different degrees of accumulation of HBsAg and HBcAg in the liver and the various histological types of hepatitis and further suggest an interplay of both hepatitis B virus and host immune response in the development and pathogenesis of hepatitis B.",

We found that the closed circular DNA fraction, extracted from monkey cells at 70 h after infection with nondefective SV40 at a multiplicity of infection of 6 PFU/cell, contained oversized molesules (1.1 to 2.0 fractional lengths of SV40 DNA) constituting about 8% of the molecules having lengths equal to or shorter than SV40 dinner DNA. The oversized molecules had the entired SV40 sequences. The added DNA was heterogeneous in length. The sites of addition were not specific with reference to the EcoRi site. These results suggest that recombination between monkey and SV40 DNAs or partial duplication of SV40 DNA occurs at many sites on the SV40 chromosome. The integrated SV40 DNA is excised and replicates in activated heterokaryons. In this system, besides SV40 DNA we found heterogeneous undersized and oversized molecules containing SV40 sequences in the closed circular DNA population. Additions differeing in size appeared to be overlapping and to have occurred at a preferential site on the SV40 chromosome. These results support the hypothesis that host DNA can be added to SV40 DNA at the site of integration at the time of excision.",

    "input": "We have previously described the isolation, from nuclei of monkey cells infected with Simian virus 40 (SV40), of a nucleoprotein complex which is able to achieve viral transcription. This complex contains SV40 DNA and RNA polymerase II molecules which have initiated transcription during the viral development. We show here, by molecular hybridization experiments, that most of the templates active in SV40 transcription can be dissociated from host DNA. In conditions where supercoiled SV40 DNA form I sediments at 21 S, the transcription complex has a sedimentation coefficient of about 25 S. Inhibition of viral DNA synthesis by cytosine arabinonucleoside or chloroquine does not affect the activity of the transcription complex, which suggests that replicating molecules are not required for viral RNA synthesis and that SV40 DNA form I could serve as template for late SV40 transcription. A large fraction of the RNA synthesized in vitro remains associated with the SV40 DNA template in cesium sulfate density gradient. The RNA chains produced by the complex are heterogeneous in size, most of them being as large or larger than the viral genome.",

The linear DNA was produced by cleavage of closed circular DNA with DNase I in the presence of Mn2+, followed, in some cases, by mild digestion with lambda 5'-exonuclease. The SV40 map location and the size of each deletion were determined by using the S1 nuclease mapping procedure (Shenk et al., 1975) and the change in size of fragments produced by Hind II + III endonuclease cleavage. Deletions in at least three regions of the SV40 chromosome have slight or no effect on the rate or yield of viral multiplication and on vira-induced cellular transformation. These regions are located at the following coordinates on the SV40 physical map: 0.17 to 0.18; 0.54 to 0.59; and 0.68 to 0.74.",

In an attempt to clarify the nature of the host DNA sequences neighbouring the viral DNA it was found that reiterated host DNA must be within the range of 800 bases from the viral sequences. Reassociation kinetics and treatment of the reassociated viral-host DNA sequences with single strand-specific S1 nuclease have shown that unique host DNA sequences are always present in close neighbourhood of the viral DNA.

The DNA products of replication were also found as nucleoprotein complexes. Forty percent of the replicating viral DNA, labeled in vivo, was converted into covalently closed, superhelical DNA during incubation in vitro. Although the remaining labeled DNA was not converted into mature viral DNA, it was elongated to its full genome length. Failure to terminate replication successfully was not caused by endonuclease activity, since covalently closed DNA, labeled in vivo, was not damaged during incubation in vitro. When [alpha-32P]dATP was present during the incubation, the label appeared first in replicating DNA and later in mature DNA; no unusual products were labeled in vitro. The covalently closed SV40 DNA made in vitro had the same superhelical density as viral DNA made in vivo.

    "input": "Biochemical methods are presented for determining the structure of spliced RNAs present in cells at low concentrations. Two cytoplasmic spliced viral RNAs were detected in CV-1 cells during the early phase of simian virus 40 (SV40) infection. One is 2200 nucleotides in length and is composed of two parts, 330 and 1900 nucleotides, mapping from approximately 0.67 to approximately 0.60 and from approximately 0.54 to approximately 0.14, respectively, on the standard viral map. The other is 2500 nucleotides long and also is composed of two parts, 630 and 1900 nucleotides mapping from approximately 0.67 to approximately 0.54 and from approximately 0.54 to approximately 0.14, respectively. Correlation of the structure of these mRNAs with the structure of the early SV40 proteins, small T antigen (17,000 daltons) and large T antigen (90,000 daltons), determined by others suggests that: (i) translation of the 2500-nucleotide mRNA yields small T antigen; (ii) translation of the 2200-nucleotide mRNA proceeds through the splice point in the RNA to produce large T antigen (and thus large T antigen is encoded in two separate regions of the viral genome); and (iii) the DNA sequences between approximately 0.67 and approximately 0.60 present in both mRNAs are translated in the same reading frame in both mRNAs to yield two separate gene products that have the same NH(2)-terminal sequence. Therefore, expression of the early SV40 genes is partially controlled at the level of splicing of RNAs.",

The biophysical properties of 99mTc pyrophosphate provide high quality imaging of the skeleton. The scans or scintiphotos render possible a more sensitive and earlier diagnosis than radiography, though bone scanning does not of course supersede radiography. The two methods are complementary. In present day oncologic practice, however, bone scintigraphy with 99mTc pyrophosphate replaces to advantage the conventional radiographic \"bone survey\". In neurology the change is already appreciable and has proved its worth.

Localization of inferior and posterior myocardial infarction is improved with imaging. Sizing of acute anterior and lateral infarcts has been accurately done in dogs and should prove helpful in patients. Extensive evaluation in both experimental animals and in patients has shown 99mTc-phosphate myocardial imaging to be a useful clinical tool, and it may be one of the most sensitive noninvasive ways presently available to identify acute myocardial necrosis.

The wide variation of corneal abnormalities suggests the possibility that several conditions previously described as separate disease entities, such as grouped vesicles, Schnyder's posterior herpes, posterior polymorphous dystrophy, and congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy, are part of the clinical spectrum of expression of a single familial corneal dystrophy. Some affected family members also had ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma.

    "input": "The treatment of Binder's maxillonasal dysostosis raises many problems and difficulties of both orthodontic and surgical natures. Orthodontic therapy should be conducted as early as possible and include, principally, an advancement of the maxilla by heavy extra-oral postero-anterior traction on an orthodontic mask. If good occlusion is obtained the patient can then be treated to improve the anatomical conditions of the muscles of the nose and upper lip. Maxillary, and more rarely mandibular osteotomies are indicated in cases with poor occlusion. When occlusion is reasonably good the hypoplasia has to be compensated for by using large portions of ilac bone to reconstruct the ridge and point of the nose. A preseptal graft on the ridge and secondarily, revisions of the point of the nose are often essential to ensure the best results.",

    "instruction": "What is the common denominator of successful therapy of absolute mandibular deficiency?",
    "input": "Carefully planned, coordinated, and executed orthodontic and surgical treatment is a viable alternative to traditional orthodontic treatment of patients with moderate mandibular deficiency. Recognition of their clinical manifestations is essential to distinguish between relative and absolute mandibular deficiency. If after clinical analysis of the Class II patient, esthetic priorities are established to maintain a balanced relationship between the upper lip and nose and not reduce the prominence of the upper lip, mandibular deficiency must be treated by surgical advancement of the mandible, superior repositioning of the maxilla, and consequent autorotational movement of the mandible forward and upward, or a combination of these procedures. The common denominator of successful therapy of absolute mandibular deficiency involves surgery to advance the mandible; relative mandibular deficiency, on the other hand, is treated by maxillary surgery to reposition the maxilla superiorly to allow forward and upward movement of the retropositioned mandible (autorotation). In actual clinical practice many patients manifest a combination of absolute and relative mandibular deficiency and are treated by maxillary and mandibular surgery. Lateral maxillary osteotomies, in concert with rapid maxillary expansion and genioplasty to alter the dimensions of the chin, are essential adjunctive surgical procedures to achieve three-dimensional esthetic and occlusal balance.",
    "output": "The common denominator of successful therapy of absolute mandibular deficiency, as described in the context, is surgery to advance the mandible. This is typically part of a comprehensive treatment plan that may also include maxillary surgery to reposition the maxilla and adjunctive surgical procedures such as lateral maxillary osteotomies, rapid maxillary expansion, and genioplasty to achieve esthetic and occlusal balance."

    "input": "The experience gathered in the correction of sagittal mandibular over- and under-development allows to make the following conclusions:--In the choice of osteotomy it is necessary that careful consideration be given not only to the proportions of the body and ramus of the mandible, but also to the angular interrelationships of mandibular bones.--Osteotomies in the body of the mandible are indicated especially in those cases where it is only necessary for parallel shifts to be made in the sagittal plane.--Osteotomies performed in the region of the angle of the mandible and the ramus of the mandible (Obwegeser-Dal Pont) enable both longitudinal compensation or adjustment in the sagitta. plane and correction of transverse deformities and unfavorable angular relationships.--In the case of backward and forward displacement of the lower jaw it is essential that the position of the chin be considered already in the stage of planning the surgical operation. Suitable corrections can be made in the course of one surgical intervention.--Preliminary orthodontic treatment, because of the creation of optimum conditions of occlusion, will in many cases provide most favorable prerequisites of a surgical intervention.",
    "output": "The type of osteotomies that enable both longitudinal compensation, correction of transverse deformities, and adjustment of unfavorable angular relationships are the ones performed in the region of the angle of the mandible and the ramus of the mandible, also known as Obwegeser-Dal Pont osteotomies. These osteotomies offer flexibility in correcting not only sagittal plane deformities but also transverse and angular deformities, making them suitable for cases requiring backward and forward displacement of the lower jaw."

In the presence of mandibular retrognathism and unfavorable growth potential (limited amount, undesirable direction), surgical mandibular lengthening should be incorporated into the treatment plan. 3. Compensation for mandibular retrognathism by conventional orthodontic and facial orthopedic treatment incurs the risk of (a) increase in nasolabial angle, (b) reduction in upper lip support, (c) increase in lower facial concavity, (d) excessive proclination of lower incisors with compromise of labial periodontal support, and (e) protracted duration of appliance therapy and accompanying detrimental periodontal and root resorption effects.",

    "instruction": "What approach is preferred for deformations such as choanal atresia?",
    "input": "For the treatment of malignancies of the nasopharynx and the middle of the base of skull the high voltage irradiation is the therapy of first choice. It can also be used in combination with cytostatic drugs or in the form of synchronization. The indication for operative procedure with functional lesions is given only in few cases. Today, operative approach is only indicated for benign pathological changes. The removal of small benign tumors, posterior conchotomy or hyperplastic tubal elevations can be performed perorally directly looking through a nasopharyngeal endoscope. The same is true for the removal of cicatricial stenoses or mucosal scars. With deformations (choanal atresia) the transpalatinal way of approach is preferred to others. This method is also convenient for large tumors of the nasopharynx, the choanas and middle of the base of skull. If this topographic region is exceeded a large combined operation (transmaxillary, paralateronasal, transpterygoidal, transcygomatical, retro-submandibular) will be necessary. With plastic reconstruction a good functional result can be obtained. This is shown with own examples.",
    "output": "The preferred approach for deformations such as choanal atresia is the transpalatinal way of approach, as mentioned in the context. This method is suitable for deformations like choanal atresia due to its direct access to the affected area. However, if the topographic region is exceeded (for instance, in larger tumors of the nasopharynx, choanas, or middle of the base of skull), a larger combined operation may be necessary."

In particular, the results from a modified intraoral surgical operation are reported. Special emphasis is placed upon the partial removal of the medial pterygoid muscle which leads to a stronger and permanent scarring. This method is particularly suited for recidivating luxations, when the condyle paths are steep, and when luxation occurs toward the end of the mandibular opening movement. When condyle paths are flat or in cases of recidives other methods are recommended (for instance osteoplasty).",
    "output": "In cases where the condyle paths are flat, an osteoplasty method is recommended instead of the modified intraoral surgical operation. This is because the described operation is more suitable for recidivating luxations when the condyle paths are steep, and when luxation occurs toward the end of the mandibular opening movement. The osteoplasty method involves reshaping the affected condyle, which may help alleviate the recurring TMJ luxation issue in flatter condyle paths."

    "input": "The operative corrections used up to now which were limited to the displacement of the maxillary frontal fragments of the alveolar process, only bring about a partial correction of the deep bite. For this reason additional operative methods on the mandible are recommended, which vary according to the bite. When the bite is neutral the fragment of the lower alveolar process should be placed deeper and should be tilted forward. On the other hand in distal bite cases the recommended procedure is, after dealing with the upper front according to maxillo-facial principles, to correct the mandibular retrusion and deep bite by deepening and advancing the lower alveolar process.",
    "output": "In cases of a neutral bite where a deep bite needs correction, the recommended procedure is to place the fragment of the lower alveolar process deeper and tilt it forward. This is done to correct the deep bite while maintaining the neutral bite. However, it's important to note that this is a surgical procedure and should be performed by a qualified oral and maxillofacial surgeon.

When the entire maxilla and mandible are freed from their relationship with the remaining craniofacial complex, accurate repositioning and adequate stabilization can present problems. These problems can be minimized by operating in the proper sequence or by staging the procedure. Staging should be considered for the more complicated cases; in any instance, the maxilla should be operated on first.",

In the following, there will be indicated the approved techniques and methods of suturing the cleft palate and a new method will be discussed related to the reciprocal Z-type plastic operation. In the case of speech-improving operations, excellent results can be achieved by implanting autologous costal cartilages into the posterior wall of the pharynx. Apart from a brief mutioning of transverse and diagonal facial clefts, the provision of nasal clefts with composite grafts is finally recommented.",

Adjacent epidermal cells could be distinguished on the basis of organelle content and staining intensity, suggesting that this monolayer is not composed of a homogenous cell population. At the onset of adult development the form of the epidermal cell is transformed from that typical of a quiescent cell with free ribosomes and few mitochondria to one which is metabolically active and possesses numerous apical membrane microvilli, rough endoplasmic reticulum and numerous mitochondria. On about day 5 of pharate adult development the apical plasma membrane is no longer folded but becomes folded again several days later when cuticulin and endocuticle are deposited. On about day 7, giant autophagic vacuoles are discerned that may be important in cellular reprogramming. After adult ecdysis, the epidermal cells continue to deposit endocuticle.",

    "instruction": "At what hour of development are cilia first detected in the cells?",
    "input": "1. The pregastrulation blastomers contain electron-dense granules which become localized after gastrulation in the apices of the developing epithelio-muscle cells and persist throughout larval development. The cytoplasm of the blastomeres is organized into anucleate, membrane-delimited lobules. The lobules, which persist until six hours of development, come to contain a single, peripherally located cisterna of granular endoplasmic reticulum. Microvilli are present at the earliest stages examined and persist throughout development. Cilia are first detected at four hours. 2. Gastrulation, marked by the appearance of the mesoglea, occurs between six and eight hours of development. Basal foot processes of epithelio-muscle cells are detected by eight hours, but myonemes cannot be detected until later in development. 3. Immediately following gastrulation, mucous cells begin their differentiation from dividing cells located near the apex of the ectoderm. During their differentiation, the cells elongate toward the mesoglea. 4. By 16 hours post-fertilization, a third cell type can be detected in the ectoderm. The cell, which contains no granules, has an unusual cytoplasmic organization in which fused membranes divide the cytoplasm into parallel compartments containing a single cisterna of granular endoplasmic reticulum. 5. The findings of the present study are correlated with those of previous studies of development in Pennaria and other hydroids. The possible functional roles of the Type I granules, the cytoplasmic lobules, and the nongranular cell are discussed.",

    "instruction": "What is characterized by the appearance of aggregations of finely filamentous material in the cytoplasm during the transformation of interstitial cells into oocytes?",
    "input": "We studied ultrastructure of the interstitial cells (i-cells) at successive stages of their transformation into oocytes. The i-cells that form the epidermal thickening in the genital zone of the animal start to proliferate in hydras approaching sexual reproduction. Undifferentiated i-cells are characterized by a high density of diffusely disposed ribosomes and almost total absence of membranous structures. Femal sex cells starting to undergo differentiation are characterized by the appearance of aggregations of finely filamentous material in the cytoplasm. This material is of nuclear origin and is often surrounded by mitochondria. Dimensions of the i-cells increase rapidly, and single elongated cisterns of the granular endoplasmic reticulum appear in them. These cisterns run parallel to the cell surface and give rise to minute smooth-surfaced vesicles, whose membranes fuse wtih the cytoplasmic membrane in such a way that their contents are emptied into the intercellular space. Different sectors of the cell are marked by the appearance of grouped cisterns of the granular endoplasmic reticulum. Such cisterns give rise to smooth-surfaced vesicles, which form numerous Golgi complexes. The number of mitochondria increases simultaneously; aggregations of lipid drops with glycogen granules among them start to appear; and escape of nuclear material into the cytplasm intensifies. Such cells at the stage of cytoplasmic growth and accumulation of organelles and yolk inclusions. In connection with this, it is suggested that the term \"oogonium\" (which is used to designate such cells in the literature) be retained only for proliferating i-cells containing finely filamentous nuclear material in the cytoplasm in the genital zone of the hydra.",

    "input": "The ultrastructural changes occurring in the metrial gland in the latter half of pregnancy in the rat have been studied. Typical palely stained granulated cells are present in the metrial gland up to day 20 but many granulated cells show variations in appearance which may be associated with degeneration. In some the cytoplasm is more darkly stained and such cells often have apparently empty areas of cytoplasm adjacent to the granules. From day 14 onwards many areas of the gland show cellular debris, apparently resulting from lysis of the granulated cells. However, occasionally normal granulated cells are present in blood vessels and have been observed apparently penetrating the vascular endothelium. A variety of changes was also noted in the stromal cell population. Inclusions became apparent in many of these cells; some of these consisted of lipid while others resembled granules from the typical granulated cells. Other cells with numerous inclusions appeared to be macrophages. Lysis of granulated cells in situ is compatible with suggestions that the metrial gland produces a holocrine secretion, though some normal granulated cells enter blood vessels. The stromal cells may have a phagocytic role in late pregnancy but evidence for this was inconclusive.",
    "output": "Based on the lysis of granulated cells in situ observed in the rat's metrial gland in the latter half of pregnancy, the secretion suggested to be produced is a holocrine secretion. This is because the degeneration and lysis of the granulated cells within the gland indicate that the cells are being broken down and released as a whole, which is a characteristic of holocrine secretion. However, it's also noted that some normal granulated cells enter blood vessels, which might suggest a partial exocrine secretion as well. The stromal cells, which show phagocytic changes, may have a role in the clearance of the secretion, but the evidence for this is inconclusive."

The experiments with the isolation of four animal blastomeres of the newt at the eight-cell stage of development have shown that the presumptive ectoderm is determined to the development into epidermis already at this very early stage. The electron microscopi study of epidermis developing from the explanted ectoderm has shown that by its ultrastructure it does not differ from the normal larval epidermis. The loss by the ectoderm of the competence to the development under the effect of various morphogenetic factors appears to be related to the synthesis of a protein inhibitor during gastrulation. The data on the role of cell surface, adhesion and cell affinity in the early development are considered. Differences in the structure of surface between the cells experienced and not experienced the inductive influence were revealed with the help of electron microscope. The results of studying the mechanism of reaggregation of the embryonic cells using concanavalin A are also provided.",

    "input": "Healthy germinal membranes of hydatid cysts from lungs of human and bovine sources were dissected and isolated for histochemical and histoenzymatic research. These techniques were performed in frozen sections and pieces of the whole membrane. Enzymatic research showed that the germinal membrane presents highly differentiated metabolic areas. These areas were topographically related with the origin and insertion of brood capsules, having differentiated structures for metabolic interchange with scolices. Taking our data into account it may be suggested that this functional differentiation could be transitory and variable for all the membrane surface. The accumulation of lipids and enzymes such as simple estarase, lipase, beta-HDH, alpha-GDH and NADPH-reductase in those areas, suggests that lipids are not a simple excretory product. This distribution probably implies that lipid metabolism or its resultant products are important in development and growth of scolices. In that sense other authors' findings and hypothesis about the possible existence of an endocrine system of the parasite, are considered. This idea being demonstrated in further researches, the lipid metabolic pathways shall bring a good pharmacological approach to the interference with parasite development.",
    "output": "The enzymes that were found to be accumulated in the highly differentiated metabolic areas of the germinal membrane are simple esterase, lipase, beta-HDH, alpha-GDH, and NADPH-reductase.

Cells could be maintained for a number of generations in an undifferentiated state in suspension culture. When cultured as monolayers, they grew and differentiated in a series of six defined stages described here. These stages include morphological changes (elongation, followed by cell \"spreading\" or formation of cell aggregates), and biochemical changes (appearance of nu-crystallin protein as detected by immunofluorescence). The process of differentiation appeared to be accelerated in the vicinity of elongated cells, occurred more rapidly at high cell density, and required frequent changes of medium. This suggests that cell-cell communication, and not medium factors, may be essential for promoting differentiation. The final morphology of the differentiated cells differed, depending on the embryonic age of the rats used as a source of lens epithelial cells. This implies that the programme for differentiation changes as a function of the embryonic age of the lens.",

It is suggested that these factors may be essential for promoting differentiation, rather than medium factors alone.

In pregancy there is a considerable increase in secretion. The epithelium of surface and glands becomes stratified and the nuclei of cylindrical epithelial cells withdraw from the base of the cells and often originate retronuclear vacuols. From these vacuols one has to distinguish so-called subcylindrical vacuols which only appear during pregnancy. They are seen between epithelium and basal membrane. Electron microscopical investigations show the vacuols lined partly by atrophical partly bysecretory cylindrical cells. Histochemically the contents of the vacuols are similar to the cytoplasm of cylindrical cells and the contents of glands. These alterations of the cervical mucous membrane are dependent on hormonal stimulation and in conclusion it must be possible to demonstrate the hormonal situation andits disturbances by investigations of the mucous membrane of the cervix uteri.",

The bipolar form of the undifferentiated neuroblast is maintained--at the beginning--by external factors of cell contact only. Each end-feet contains two centrioles, one of which represents the basal body of a cilium. During mitosis, the position parallel to the lumen of the spingle axis and the subsequent appearance of two identical daughter cells depend on the behaviour of the centrioles. The later may move in an abnormal direction, and induce thus an obliquely or perpendicularly laying spindle axis. These changes may influence--on the other hand--the mechanism of proliferation.",

Small membranous vesicles were present in the spore core and they disappeared as germination proceeded. After depolymerization of the cortex, and a 30% increase in spore diameter a localized gap appeared in the laminated inner coat only. This inner coat gap was narrow and could be the whole length of the spore. The germ cell appeared to grow, or to be pushed towards the inner coat gap, at which stage the outer coat disappeared in the same localized area. As the vegetative cell grew out the spore coat fell away, with loose cortical material still attached to it. The young germ cell developed a large spherical electron dense inclusion body in the cytoplasm, at the same time as the ribosomal and nuclear areas became distinct.",

The property of human peripheral blood T lymphocytes to form rosettes with sheep [total E and active or early rosette-formimg cells (RFC)] and human erythrocytes (H-RFC) was also studied. In addition, rosette formation with mouse erythrocytes (M-RFC) was investigated as a B cell marker. Decreased proportions of total E-RFC were found in one third of the patients with MM when compared to normal volunteers. By contrast, both mean percentages and ranges of active E-RFC, H-RFC, and M-RFC in the MM patients overlapped those revealed in healthy controls. The rosette-forming ability of peripheral blood lymphocytes was tested before and after treatment with levamisole, thymosin, and transfer factor in healthy controls, as well as in some groups of patients with MM active systemic lupus erythematosus and Hodgkin's disease. A positive effect of all three immunomodulating agents could only be demonstrated on cells from T cell-deficient patients.

T cells were identified by their capacity to spontaneously form rosettes with SRBCs. The percentage of B lymphocytes was determined by the erythrocyte antibody complement (EAC) rosette-forming test. The EAC complex was prepared with either whole rabbit anti-SRBC serum or with the IgM fraction of rabbit anti-SRBC serum. The two kind of erythrocyte complement rosette-forming cells (EAC-RFC) are designated erythrocyte-haemolysin-complement RFC (EA(H)C-RFC), and erythrocyte-IgM-complement RFC (EA(M)C-RFC). The percentage of total lymphocytes and T cells was not altered in MG patients. The percentage of 'active' T cells, which have been considered to be more actively involved in cellular immunity, was also similar in MG patients and controls. A significant increase in EA(H)C-RFC occurred in both thymectomized and non-thymectomized MG patients, while in B cells detected by EA(M)C-RFC no alterations were found. The increase in EA(H)C-RFC in lymphocytes from MG patients may be due to an increase in the 19S antibody-forming B lymphocytes or to an increase in T cells which have Fc receptors on their surface.",

This method is used because T cells have the capacity to form rosettes with SRBCs spontaneously. However, it's important to note that the identification of 'active' T cells, which are more actively involved in cellular immunity, was also done using rosette formation, but with a slightly different method: erythrocyte-antibody-complement (EAC) rosette-forming test, specifically the EA(H)C-RFC (erythrocyte-haemolysin-complement RFC) variant.

The latter cells partly belonged to \"null\" (non-T, non-B) cells; it was however demonstrated that 30 % of the EA-RFC were T cells (E-RFC). The lytic capacity in antibody-dependent lymphocytotoxicity (ADL) was shown to correspond with the proportions of EA-RFC in the various fractions. Non-T cells showed enhanced ADL activity when compared to the unseparated cells. Purified T cells populations also displayed ADL activity. Since the latter could not be due to contaminating non-T cells, this activity was ascribed to Fc receptor-bearing T lymphocytes.",

Depression of the number of T lymphocytes forming spontaneous rosettes with sheep erythrocytes (E rosettes) occurred in 66% of patients, whereas no difference in B lymphocytes bearing C3 receptor (EAC rosettes) was observed between psoriatics and normals. The decrease in E rosettes was associated with the active phase of the disease. This disappeared 4-6 wk after onset of remission, which suggested that the abnormality in T-cell marker distribution is transitional. Lymphocytes forming neither E nor EAC rosettes, which were found to be significantly increased in active psoriasis, were identified as T lymphocytes since they reacquired normal E rosette function during short-term preincubation with concanavalin A (Con A). A serum factor was also demonstrated which inhibited E rosette formation by normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. Its activity increased linearly within 2 mo from the onset of skin lesions. The data suggest that in active psoriasis serum factors may be coated on the lymphocyte surface membrane which may be responsible for blocking of specific receptor for sheep erythrocytes and/or interfere with T lymphocyte function.",

The percentage of T cells in the patients was similar to that of normal subjects as judged by the cytotoxicity assay (65 to 90%). In addition, absolute T-lymphocyte counts were normal in 63% of the patients and were generally reduced only in those with lymphopenia. The percentage of T lymphocytes determined by the E-rosette assay was similar to that determined by the cytotoxicity assay in normal controls, but was significantly lower than that determined by the cytotoxicity assay in the patients. Moreover, the decreased response to PHA stimulation in the patients was directly correlated with the decrease in E-rosette formation.

    "input": "The spontaneous inactivation of yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was found to fit a simple two-state model at pH 8.5 and 25 degrees. The first step is a relatively rapid dissociation of the tetramer to dimers with the equilibrium largely in favor of the tetramer. In the absence of NAD+ the dimer inactivates irreversibly. The apoenzyme is quite stable with a half-life for complete activity loss proportional to the square root of the enzyme concentration. Perturbances of the protein structure (by pH, ionic strength, and specific salts), which have no effect on the tetrameric state of the molecule, result in an alteration of the cooperativity of NAD+ binding, the reactivity of the active-site sulfhydryl group, and the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Covalent modification of two of the four active-site sulfhydryl groups has profound effects on the enzymic activity which are mediated by changes in the subunit interactions. Sedimentation analysis and hybridization studies indicate that the interaction between subunits remains strong after covalent modification. Under normal physiological and equilibrium dialysis conditions the protein is a tetramer. Equilibrium dialysis studies of NAD+ binding to the enzyme at pH 8.5 and 25 degrees reveal a mixed cooperativity pattern. A model consistent with these observations and the observed half-of-the-sites reactivity is that of ligand induced sequential conformational changes which are transferred across strongly interacting subunit domains. Methods for distinguishing negatively cooperative binding patterns from mixtures of denatured enzyme and multiple species are discussed.",

In the unliganded pyridoxal form of the enzyme at pH 6.0 and 20 degrees, 43% of the total 411 peptide hydrogens per subunit exchange within the first 10 min. An additional 9% exchange slowly in the following time period to 360 min. A quite similar exchange curve is obtained with the pyridoxamine form of the enzyme, indicating close correspondence in conformation of both unliganded forms of the enzyme. Formation of a nonproductive adsorption complex of the pyridoxal enzyme with 2-oxoglutarate or of the pyridoxamine enzyme with glutamate alters the exchange characteristics only slightly. In contrast, the formation of an equilibrium mixture of the covalent transamination intermediates, which occurs in the silultaneous presence of the amino acid and the keto acid substrate, results in a marked retardation of hydrogen exchange, reflecting a substantial tightening of the structure of the enzyme. The exchange reactions of at least 26 peptide hydrogens per subunit (6% of the total) are retarded by a factor of 6 on the average. The occurrence of such syncatalytic conformational changes reflects energetic coupling of the covalency changes at the active site with conformational changes of the macromolecular protein matrix that may contribute to optimizing the free energy profile of enzymic transamination.",

First, the conformational change due to a pH jump produced by mixing with alkali was monitored as a function of time at 245 nm through the ionization of phenolic hydroxyl groups of tyrosine residues which were originally buried and finally become exposed due to the pH jump. Three distinct phases of conformational change were clearly recognized by this method by varying the final pH values. Each phase involved the exposure of an essentially definite number of tyrosine residues, whose rate constant was crucially dependent on pH. Second, these phases of conformational change were subjected to examination in terms of the optical rotation change at 411 nm and the reversibility upon reverse pH jump with respect to conformational reconstitution, as observed through the protonation ofphenolic hydroxyl groups of ionized tyrosine residues and the enzyme activity. The first phase, which occurs above pH 12.5, involves no change in the optical rotation and is reversible as observed by the above two monitoring methods. In contrast, the other two phases, which are observed above pH 12.7, are accompanied by an optical rotation change and no appreciable reversibility was detected by these methods.",

    "input": "The hydrolysis of dipeptides by purified yeast dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.?) shows marked deviations from Michaelis-Menten kinetics over a wide range of pH. Quite anomalous kinetics is observed between pH 6 and 7, indicating a drastic change in the enzyme's properties. A reasonable explanation is provided by the assumption of a conformational transition brought about either by pH shifts or, at a constant pH, by changes in the substrate concentration. The transition, which may have a half-life on the order of minutes under appropriate conditions, is a distinctly cooperative process, with a dependence on ligand concentration higher than first order. The two forms of the enzyme differ clearly from each other with respect to various properties. The magnitudes and pH dependence of the kinetic parameters as well as the type of inhibition (or activation) exerted by amino acids and other ligands are different, as are their heat stabilities and the rates of inactivation by photooxidation of proteolytic  degradation. Neither the molecular weight nor the gross conformation of the enzyme changes during the transition, so it seems to be due to a local isomerization affecting mainly the geometry of the active site. The sensitivity of dipeptidase to changes in the concentrations of substrates and other ligands is most pronounced exactly at the values of pH known to prevail in the living yeast cell. Thus the observed effects, which modulate dipeptidase activities within wide and limits, according to the amounts of dipeptides and amino acids present, are likely to play a role in the regulation of the enzyme in vivo.",
    "output": "The range of pH where quite anomalous kinetics is observed for the hydrolysis of dipeptides by purified yeast dipeptidase is between pH 6 and 7. This anomalous behavior is due to a conformational transition in the enzyme, which may be brought about by pH shifts or changes in substrate concentration. This transition, which is a cooperative process, results in distinctly different kinetic parameters, types of inhibition (or activation), heat stabilities, and rates of inactivation by photooxidation or proteolytic degradation for the two forms of the enzyme. The sensitivity of dipeptidase to changes in substrate and ligand concentrations is most pronounced at these pH values, suggesting that this phenomenon may play a role in regulating the enzyme in vivo."

    "input": "Allosteric interactions in the cupro-heme enzyme tryptophan oxygenase (EC 1.13.11.11) of Pseudomonas acidovorans are shown to be pH-dependent. Increasing the assay pH from 6.0 to 8.0 progressively desensitizes the enzyme from both homotropic and heterotropic ligand interactions. This pH-dependent reversible transition has a pK of 6.2. Hill coefficients for the substrate L-tryptophan of 2.0 and 1.4 were measured at pH 6.0 and pH 7.0, respectively. In attempting to identify the enzymatic residue (or residues) responsible for these pH-dependent effects, the enzyme was observed to be irreversibly inactivated by photoinduced oxidation in the presence of the sensitizer, methylene blue. The photoinactivated enzyme showed a loss of one-half its Soret (405 nm) absorption which accompanied the loss of one-half its heme and histidine contents. This first order photoinduced inactivation was pH-dependent and corresponded to a requirement for a protonated species with a pK of 6.2. These results suggest that histidine residues may be involved in the catalytic function and in mediating cooperative interactions of tryptophan oxygenase. Absolute and difference sedimentation velocity analyses indicate that the molecule undergoes a conformational transition when the pH is decreased from pH 8.0 to pH 6.0. This conformational alteration, measured as a 3.9% increase in S20, w can be regarded as an equivalent decrease in the frictional coefficient. If, a more or less spherical shape to the molecule is assumed, then, the 3.9% decrease in the frictional coefficient between pH 8.0 and 6.0 corresponds to a 12% decrease in apparent hydrodynamic volume of the enzyme. Thus, protonation of an enzymatic moiety, possibly histidine, determines both the conformational and functional interactions between enzymatic sites.",

The log Vmax versus pH curve for each of the enzymes shows a monotonic increase between pH 5.5 and 7, and a plateau from pH 7.5 upwards. These curves, and their temperature dependence, are compatible with the presence of a single ionizable group which, in its conjugate acid form, renders the enzyme-substrate complex inactive. The pK of this group is 6.94 at 18.5 degrees, and its enthalpy of ionization is 7.0 kcal mol-1. The log Km versus pH curves show a broad plateau between pH 6.2 and 8.2, interrupted by a sharp minimum at pH 7.2 for variant B, while variants A and A- show sharp maxima at pH 7.2 and 7.45, respectively. It is proposed that this unusual behavior depends on the dissociation of the tetrameric enzyme to dimers in this pH region. Specifically, it is shown that  a sharp maximum or minimum of Km can arise if cooperative uptake or release of protons is linked to dimer formation, and if the degree of cooperativity is different for the free enzyme compared to the enzyme-substrate complex. The pH dependence of the equilibrium between the tetrameric and the dimeric form of the enzyme has been determined by gel filtration for the same three genetic variants B, A, and A-. In agreement with previous ultracentrifugal data, the enzyme is a tetramer in acid solution and a dimer in alkaline solution. The pH at which half of the enzyme is in dimeric form, under our experimental conditions, is 7.15 +/- 0.05 for variants A and B, and 7.35 +/- 0.05 for variant A-. These pH values correspond closely, for all three variants, to the sharp extrema in the pH dependence of their Km values for glucose 6-phosphate. From the measured dissociation equilibria, it can be inferred that the tetramer-dimer transition entails cooperative release of protons. The degree of cooperativity estimated from these data agrees closely with the independent estimate based on the pH dependence of Km.",

The reciprocal of the slowest relaxation time was found to be linearly dependent upon the enzyme concentration for relatively low enzyme concentrations, as predicted earlier. Use of the wide pH-range necessitated expression of the four apparent dissociation constants of the catalytic reaction cycle in terms of pH-independent constants. The system was described in terms of only one (or two) catalysis-linked protons not associated with the electron transfer. Protonic steps in a buffered system are in rapid equilibrium, too fast to be measured with the equipment available. Assuming only two of the four bimolecular reaction steps in the four-step cycle are fast compared to the remaining two, six cases may be considered with six expressions for the reciprocal of the slowest relaxation time. Comparison with the experimental data revealed that the bimolecular reaction steps governing the slowest relaxation time change with pH. Above the effective time resolution of the temperature-lump instrument with fluorescence detection (0.1 msec) only one other relaxation time was detectable and only at pH 9. This relaxation time, found to be independent of the concentration of all reactants within experimental error (r = 10 +/- 5 msec), is most likely due to an interconversion among ternary complexes.",

The major metabolite in rat urine was unconjugated, but the majority of radioactive materials in mouse and human urine were conjugated with glucuronic acid. Identification of the rat urinary metabolite of cyproheptadine as an epoxide was accomplished with mass spectrometry and other methods. The rat metabolite was 10.11 -epoxydesmethylcyproheptadine and accounted for about 25% of a 45-mg dose of cyproheptadine per kg. Only a small amount of this epoxide was found in mouse urine, and none was apparent in the urine of two humans who received 5 mg of the drug. Dihydrodiols, which could arise by epoxide hydrase hydrolysis of possible 10.11-epoxy metabolites, were not found in the urine of any of the species studied.

The purified enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 70,000 and appears to consist of a single polypeptide chain. The enzyme is free of DNase, but has RNase H activity. Analysis of the requirements for optimal rates of DNA synthesis by this enzyme using synthetic and natural template-primers has revealed template-specific variations in such requirements. During these studies it was observed that DNA synthesis catalyzed by Rauscher leukemia virus DNA polymerase is inhibited by the addition of inorganic phosphate. An analysis of the mechanism of phosphate inhibition was carried out using the synthetic template-primer poly(A)-(dT)10. It appears that by some mechanism, possibly involving the substrate binding site of the enzyme, phosphate ions inhibit DNA synthesis with a more acute effect on the rate of chain growth than on that of initiation. The extension of these studies to DNA synthesis catalyzed by a variety of mammalian type C viral reverse transcriptases revealed that low levels ( less than or equal to 2 mM) of inorganic phosphate strongly inhibited DNA synthesis. The susceptibility to phosphate inhibition appears unique to mammalian type C viral enzymes since the type B viral enzyme, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, avian myeloblastosis virus and Mason Pfizer monkey tumor virus reverse transcriptase and cellular DNA polymerases alpha and gamma are not inhibited by inorganic phosphate. This phenomenon of phosphate inhibition of various DNA polymerases, therefore, provides a new basis for the differentiation of the sources and nature of these enzymes.",

A number of different DNAs were transcribed by the enzyme from A. calcoaceticus. Maximal RNA synthesis occurred at pH 8.7, 10 mM Mg2+, or 0.3 mM Mn2+ and at a total ionic strength of 0.1. Higher ionic strengths led to increasing inhibition of transcription and at mu = 0.4 complete inhibition was observed. The mechanism of inhibition of salt was not related to the initiation event as observed with T4 core RNA polymerase (R.Kleppe, 1975).

At low ionic strength, enzyme species with sedimentation coefficients, s20,w, of 5.8S, 12.4S, and 19.3S were present.

The products of synthesis are not covalently attached to the template and sediment as short (12S) DNA chains in alkaline sucrose gradients. Sealing of these fragments into DNA of higher molecular weight requires the presence of E.coli DNA polymerase I and T7 ligase. Examination of the products in the electron microscope reveals many large, forked molecules and a few \"eye\"-shaped structures resembling the early replicative intermediates normally observed in vivo.",
    "output": "In addition to the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, DNA synthesis in vitro using intact duplex T7 DNA as template requires four ribonucleoside triphosphates. Also, three T7 phage-induced proteins are essential: DNA-priming protein, T7 DNA polymerase (gene 5-protein plus host factor), and T7 DNA-binding protein. The reaction is inhibited by low concentrations of actinomycin D. The priming protein acts as a novel RNA polymerase to form a priming segment, which is then extended by T7 DNA polymerase. T7 RNA polymerase can only partially substitute for the DNA-priming protein. E.coli DNA polymerase I and T7 ligase are necessary for sealing the synthesized DNA fragments into DNA of higher molecular weight. The products of synthesis are short (12S) DNA chains that sediment in alkaline sucrose gradients.

    "instruction": "What was the pH optimum for the purified DNA polymerase using an \"activated\" DNA template-primer?",
    "input": "The DNA polymerase of early embryos of Drosophila melanogaster has been purified to near-homogeneity. The purified enzyme gave a single, catalytically active protein band after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, under nondenaturing conditions. Four polypeptides with molecular weights 43,000, 46,000, 58,000, and 148,000 were resolved when this band was electrophoresed under denaturing conditions. At high ionic strengths, the DNA polymerase had a sedimentation coefficient of 8.7 S, a Stokes radius of 78 A and frictional ratio of 1.81, parameters that yield a molecular weight of 280,000. The purified DNA polymerase possessed no detectable endo- or exodeoxyribonuclease, ATPase, or RNA polymerase activity. Using an \"activated\" DNA template-primer, the enzyme had a pH optimum of 8.5. It was stimulated by (NH4)2SO4, KCl, and to a lesser extent, NaCl. A divalent metal cation was absolutely required; MgCl2 stimulating activity 7-fold more than MnCl2. It was inhibited by low concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide and Aphidicolon. Thus the DNA polymerase of D. melanogaster resembles most closely the alpha-DNA polymerases that have been purified from mammalian cells.",

    "instruction": "What was the optimum concentration of Mg2+ for the DNA polymerase activity in mouse sperm nuclei?",
    "input": "The presence of a nuclear DNA polymerase in mouse sperm from adult testes has been confirmed and the properties of this enzyme further investigated. This activity was shown to be greatly enhanced by treating the spermatozoa with methanol or ethanol before incubation in the reaction medium or by their addition in small amounts to this medium. It was protected against degradation by nuclear proteases by adding soybean trypsin inhibitor and was stimulated by ATP. It was found to be Mg2+ dependent (optimum concentration: 7.5 mM), DNA dependent, and all four deoxynucleoside triphosphates were needed for optimal reaction. The radioactive acid-precipitable product of polymerization was not eliminated by organic solvents, nor by pronase, ribonuclease or by nuclease S1; however, it was converted to a large extent to acid-soluble products by pancreatic deoxyribonuclease. Since it was only partially solubilized by Triton X-100, it therefore did not appear to be preferentially associated with the nuclear membranes. The activity recovered after incubation depended also on the pH (optimum at pH 8.3) and did not work well in a medium for DNA polymerase alpha. The temperature for maximum incorporation of nucleotides was found to be 32 degrees C and, under our conditions, the reaction was linear for 30 min. The DNA polymerase activity was inhibited by low and high concentrations of KCl. It was not lowered by N-ethylmaleimide or p-hydroxymercuribenzoate; urea slightly stimulated the reaction and this stimulation was reversed by subsequent treatment with N-ethylmaleimide. Actinomycin D (40 mug/ml), ethidium bromide (25--50 muM), netropsin (5--50 mug/ml), and spermidine (0.5--2.5 mM) lowered the polymerization of DNA precursors. The nuclear enzyme could shift from the endogenous template to activated exogenous calf thymus DNA, the resulting nuclear radioactivity being reduced. The endogenous DNP template ability was not increased by deoxyribonuclease activation according to the method of Aposhian and Kornberg (J. Biol. Chem. (1962) 237, 519--525) suggesting that the amount of DNA polymerase associated with chromatin was probably limiting the reaction. The DNA polymerase activity detected in mouse sperm nuclei has numerous properties of low molecular weight DNA polymerases (DNA polymerase beta) reported in several eukaryotic organisms.",

    "input": "Otitis media affects nearly every child at some time; many children have mild-to-moderate hearing losses for prolonged periods. The effects of these losses on language and educational development may be significant; possible mechanisms are discussed. Especially in suboptimal listening situations, speech perception may be impaired by even a mild hearing loss. Patterns of imperception are predicted by comparison of composite audiometric data from children with middle ear effusions with speech power data, and by analysis of sound pressure waveforms of speech filtered to simulate the typical hearing loss of these patients. A new method of analysis of brain stem evoked responses, yielding response components attributable to binaural interaction, is reported. This and other evoked response techniques may be able to identify objective changes in auditory nervous system function attributable to relative sensory deprivation during development. Finally, directions for further research in this area are discussed.",
    "output": "In suboptimal listening situations, speech perception may be impaired by even a mild hearing loss. This is because the hearing loss can affect the ability to understand speech, especially in noisy or complex environments. This impairment can have significant effects on language and educational development in children. The effects can be predicted by comparing composite audiometric data from children with middle ear effusions with speech power data, and by analyzing sound pressure waveforms of speech filtered to simulate the typical hearing loss of these patients.

    "input": "Residual hearing capabilities of nine severely and profoundly retarded multihandicapped deaf-blind children were determined with an operant procedure that allowed the children to respond by making a selection between two alternative responses. One response option resulted in the presentation of auditory reinforcement (pure tones and speech stimuli of various frequencies); the other option resulted in no reinforcement. Levels of the sound intensity were varied systematically to obtain a \"threshold\" for selective responding. Each of the severely damaged \"untestable\" children made numerous meaningful responses throughout the testing sessions, thereby revealing the levels of intensity that could be heard and those that were not high enough to elicit preferential responding. The children responded comparably in conditions employing pure tones and speech. The responses of most of the children were comparable across frequency conditions, although some of the children's records show selective responding at lower levels of intensity for certain frequencies than for others. We also found that varying the level of intensity of the stimuli not only affected the children's selective behavior, but also their time on task measures and their individual patterns of responding.",

Particular emphasis is placed on the diagnostic value of our methods for early tumor detection. Of the audiometric suprathreshold methods, the Carhart test, stapedius reflex audiometry, and the speech audiogram constituted the most reliable procedures for defining deafness due to involvement of the auditory nerve by tumor. All of the patients examined by electronystagmography showed a significant vestibular hypoexcitability on the side of tumor involvement. The methodology of the vestibular testing and its evaluation are detailed. Although these methods are complicated and time-consuming, they enable an early tumor diagnosis to be made so that surgical intervention will result in preservation of the facial nerve and markedly lessen surgical mortality.",

Special precautions were taken to identify and separate artefactual, neural and microphonic components. These included shielding of the earphone, a rubber tube to introduce a time delay between artefact and biological response and white noise to mask the neural component. The cochlear microphonic potential was larger in amplitude in response to low frequency sounds and had a high threshold. Two clinical cases of cochlear hearing loss are presented, both lacking neural responses. The cochlear microphonic potential was present in one of them (i.e., neural hearing loss) and absent in the other (i.e., sensory hearing loss).",

    "input": "Congenital atresia of the ear requires prompt diagnosis and an early assessment of hearing. In bilateral atresia, aural rehabilitation should be started early in life to avoid late sequelae of speech problems. In unilateral atresia, the need is not urgent if the child hears normally in the other ear. Polytomography and audiometric testing are the two most important parts of the patient's evaluation. Precise audiometric testing may be difficult, or even impossible, in these children. The indications for surgery are presented. The risk of injuring an abnormally placed facial nerve remains a deterrent to many otologic surgeons who would otherwise operate on atresia. Surgery for correction of atresia was performed on 20 ears in 18 patients. A method of fascia graft overlay in conjunction with a center-hole skin graft was used. In 14 or 17 ears where an attempt was made at hearing rehabilitation the average preoperative air conduction threshold was 59 db and the average postoperative air conduction threshold was 24 db. Two unique cases are discussed in detail. One is a primary cholesteatoma in association with atresia, and the other is a finding of primitive and embryonic subepithelial tissue in the mastoid air cell system.",

The patients were classified into seven clefting categories, microtia/artresia, facial defects, cranial defects and miscellaneous anomalies of the head and neck. X-ray findings, those present at middle ear surgery and those studied at autopsy, are summarized. The incidence of hearing loss is 88 per cent.

This involves a minimum of surgical intervention and infective risk, preserves the possibility of remission and allows the application of later developments. The signal used for stimulation is designed to be matched both to the deaf lip-reader's needs and to his new, restricted, auditory ability. This is done by concentrating on the acoustic pattern components of speech which carry intonation and voiced-voiceless information. Surgical electrophysical, psychoacoustic and speech perceptual aspects of our work with twelve patients are described. The tests involve responses, for example, relating to: threshold for sinusoids; frequency difference limens; periodic -aperiodic discrimination; stress placement; and consonant labelling using combined visual and electrical inputs. Relatively extensive measurements were made with six patients. Significant individual differences were found and the sets of responses provide an essential basis for an appraisal of the potential usefulness of our work to the individual patient. Possible reasons for the individual differences are discussed.

These peripheral functional disorders, particularly those which occur in older individuals, derive from preceding injury as well as intercurrent or chronic diseases of the inner ear which may be coincidentally associated with age. The real aging process of the hearing system is presumed to occur predominantly in central pathways and their interconnections; this appears as a hearing disorder only if there is additionally present a peripheral hearing impairment which is not dependent on age. As this differs greatly among individuals, it would seem that the term \"prebyacusis\" should not be considered a hearing norm of aging.",

However, in a follow-up study one year after the completion of training, the good effect was reduced in the trained group, although still higher over-all than the control group.

The comparatively high proportion of individual results without pathological findings obtained from high-risk children indicates that reliable diagnostic conclusions can be drawn only if the results of various examination techniques are summarized.

All lipoprotein classes were found to be present in increased concentrations. The apolipoprotein composition of the various lipoprotein fractions was studied by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis in the presence of 8 M urea, isoelectric focusing in the presence of 8 M urea, and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels. In the very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) of diabetic rats, there was a marked alteration in the relative amounts of C proteins by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, and this was found by isoelectric focusing to be primarily a relative increase in C-III-3 apoprotein and a decrease in C-III-O. In addition, in the diabetic rats, the VLDL contained a protein of mol wt 46,000, the A-IV protein, which normally is only present in the high density lipoproteins. In the high density lipoproteins, (HDL) the same alterations in pattern of the C proteins seen in the VLDL were present. Furthermore, the arginine-rich and A-IV protein normally present in HDL could not be detected in the HDL, although the other apolipoproteins are present. Apolipoprotein concentrations were determined by quantitative immunoelectrophoresis. It was found that in the diabetic rats there was an increase in the total amount of apo-B in the plasma, with the increment divided proportionately between the VLDL and the low density lipoprotein (LDL). The total apo-C concentration of plasma increased minimally. The A-IV concentration of plasma increased by 27%; it decreased markedly in the HDL, but appeared in increased amounts in both VLDL and in the d greater than 1.21 fraction. The arginine-rich protein decreased by 63% in the plasma and decreased significantly in the HDL, but increased in VLDL, LDL, and in the d greater than 1.21 fraction. These alterations in apolipoprotein patterns in diabetic animals suggest that the apolipoproteins may play an important role in determining the concentration of various lipoprotein fractions, or may be the result of altered metabolism of the lipoproteins. These lipoproteins with altered apolipoprotein composition may have important biologic differences from normal lipoporteins.

    "instruction": "What effect did Pronase treatment have on LDL binding in VA-4 cells?",
    "input": "Serum lipoproteins control cell cholesterol content by regulating its uptake, biosynthesis, and excretion. Monolayers of cultured fibroblasts were used to study interactions with human high density (HDL) and low density (LDL) lipoproteins doubly labeled with [(3)H]cholesterol and (125)I in the apoprotein moiety. In the binding assay for LDL, the absence of specific LDL receptors in type II hypercholesterolemic fibroblasts was confirmed, whereas monolayers of virus-transformed human lung fibroblasts (VA-4) exhibited LDL binding characteristics essentially the same as normal lung fibroblasts. In the studies of HDL binding, specific HDL binding sites were demonstrated in normal and virus-transformed fibroblasts. In addition, type II hypercholesterolemic cells, despite the loss of LDL receptors, retained normal HDL binding sites. No significant competition was displayed between the two lipoprotein classes for their respective binding sites over a 5-fold concentration range. In VA-4 cells, the amount of lipoprotein required to saturate half the receptor sites was 3.5 micro g/ml (9 x 10(-9) M) for LDL and 9.1 micro g/ml (9 x 10(-8) M) for HDL. Pronase treatment reduced LDL binding by more than half but had no effect on HDL binding. Chloroquine, a lysomal enzyme inhibitor, stimulated net LDL uptake 3.5-fold by increasing internalized LDL but had essentially no effect on HDL uptake. Further experiments were conducted using doubly labeled lipoproteins to characterize the interaction of LDL and HDL with cells. While the cholesterol and protein moieties of LDL were incorporated into cells at similar rates, the uptake of the cholesterol moiety of HDL was 5 to 10 times more rapid than that of the protein component. Furthermore, the apoprotein component of LDL is extensively degraded following exposure, whereas the apoprotein moiety of HDL retains its macromolecular chromatographic characteristics. These results indicate that HDL and LDL bind to cultured cells at separate sites and that further processing of the two lipoprotein classes appears to take place by fundamentally different mechanisms.-Wu, J-D., J. Butler, and J. M. Bailey. Lipid metabolism in cultured cells XVIII. Comparative uptake of low density and high density lipoproteins by normal, hypercholesterolemic, and tumor virus-transformed human fibroblasts.",
    "output": "Pronase treatment had a significant effect on LDL binding in VA-4 cells, reducing it by more than half. However, it had no effect on HDL binding in these cells. This suggests that the mechanisms of binding and further processing of LDL and HDL by cells may be fundamentally different."

    "input": "High density lipoproteins (HDL) of plasma from patients with long-standing cholestasis were studied by several methods including crossed immunoelectrophoresis, gel filtration, and zonal ultracentrifugation. The crossed immunoelectrophoretic pattern against anti-HDL was characterized by the presence of several immunoprecipitates, in striking contrast to the pattern formed by normal HDL. One of these precipitates corresponded to a lipoprotein species dominated by apoprotein A-II (apo A-II). Zonal ultracentrifugation of cholestatic plasma showed a decrease of HDL and a disappearance of the normal delineation of HDL2 and HDL3. In addition a new component designated HDL1-C was observed. Consistent results were found at studies of the molecular size distribution of cholestatic HDL by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The lipid and apoprotein composition of isolated cholestatic HDL fractions differed considerably from normal. Most notable were the high proportions of phospholipids and free cholesterol and the occurrence of the apoprotein E (arginine-rich protein) in remarkably high amounts especially in the abnormal HDL1-C.",

    "input": "The catabolism of human and rat 125I-labelled very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) was compared by perfusing the lipoproteins through beating rat hearts. Triacylglycerol was removed from the VLDL to a greater extent than the protein moiety, leaving remnants containing relatively more apo-B and less apo-C. The change in apo-C content of the remnants correlated with the loss of triacylglycerol. The extent of removal of triacylglycerol from the rat and human VLDL was similar and in most cases appeared to saturate the heart lipoprotein lipase. The remnants were slightly smaller in size than the VLDL, and included particles which appeared to be partially emptied. In addition to remnants of d less than 1.019 g/ml, iodinated lipoproteins derived from rat and human VLDL were recovered at d 1.019-1.063 and 1.063-1.21 g/ml. The former contained largely cholesterol and cholesteryl esters, while phospholipids were the dominant lipid in the latter. An average of 40% of the 125I-labelled apoprotein lost from the VLDL was associated with the perfused hearts. Very little d 1.019-1.063 g/ml lipoprotein was produced from low (physiological) concentrations of rat VLDL, most of the lipoprotein being removed by the heart. However, lipoproteins of density 1.019-1.063 g/ml were formed from human VLDL at all concentrations in the perfusate, as well as from higher concentrations of the rat VLDL. Agarose gel filtration of lipoproteins following heart perfusion with human VLDL revealed large aggregates containing particles which resemble low density lipoproteins (LDL) in electron microscopic appearance and apoprotein composition, since they contain largely apo-B. These data suggest that at normal concentrations rat VLDL are almost completely catabolised and taken up by the heart without the formation of LDL, while LDL is produced from human VLDL at all concentrations.",

    "instruction": "What was the mean LDL-cholesterol concentration in the patients with Type V lipoprotein pattern?",
    "input": "The metabolism of low density lipoprotein (LDL) was studied in eighteen hypertriglyceridaemic patients by injecting autologous radioiodinated LDL. Over 95% of the label was bound to the protein moiety of LDL and therefore the metabolic data reflect the fate and distribution of LDL apoprotein (apo B). The hypertriglyceridaemic subjects included ten with Type V, five with Type IV, two with Type III and one with Type IIb hyperlipoproteinaemia. For comparison identical studies were carried out in seven normal subjects and five patients with heterozygous familial hyperbetalipoproteinaemia (Type IIa). The groups differed considerably in mean LDL-cholesterol concentration. The patients with Type V lipoprotein pattern had significantly lower LDL-cholesterol concentration (mean 0.754 g/1) than the normal group (mean 1.237 g/1). Raised LDL-cholesterol levels were observed in all patients with heterozygous familial hyperbetalipoproteinaemia. The synthetic rate of LDL-apoprotein was found to be similar in all three groups (hypertriglyceridaemic, normal and hypercholesterolaemic). The highest synthetic rate was observed in the patient with Type IIb pattern. However, the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of LDL-apoprotein differed significantly. The highest mean FCR was found in the Type V group (0.65 +/- 0.17 day-1) compared with 0.41 +/- 0.09 day-1 in the normal group and 0.185 +/- 0.05 day-1 in the Type IIa group. A strong inverse correlation was found between FCR and LDL apoprotein concentration in the whole series (r = -0.90, p less than 0.001) as well as within the Type V group (r = -0.87, p less than 0.01). These data indicate that the low plasma levels of LDL frequently observed in patients with very high plasma triglyceride levels are due to a high removal rate of LDL in these patients rather than to abnormal LDL synthesis.",

    "input": "Acute biliary obstruction in the rat is associated with striking alterations of the plasma level and the physico-chemical properties of plasma lipoproteins. 1. The level of very low density lipproteins (VLDL) in plasma increases from 2 to 3 fold. The chemical composition of VLDL is characterized by a high content of phospholipids and cholesterol and by a diminution of the relative content of triacylglycerols and protein. On cellulose acetate electrophoresis, VLDL show a beta-mobility. 2. The plasma concentration of low density lipoproteins (1.019--1.063 g/ml, LDL2) increases several fold above the control level. Phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol are the major components of this fraction which contains only a minute amount of cholesteryl ester (4%) and triacylglycerols (10%). LDL2 contain a component which migrates to the cathode in 1% agar gel electrophoresis. Separation of LDL2 by gel filtration on 2% agarose column results in the identification of three subfractions. Subfraction I contains a large proportion of cholesterol and triacylgylcerols, subfraction II is rich in unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids whereas subfraction III has a chemical composition fairly similar to that of the control LDL2. 3. The level of high density lipoproteins (HDL) also increases after bile duct ligation. The chemical composition of HDL2 (1.063-1.125 g/ml) is characterized by a high content of unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids and by a remarkable reduction in the content of cholesteryl esters and protein.",

However, it's important to note that this value is an estimate from the context and may not be exact. For a definitive answer, further experimental data or research would be required."

    "input": "Human plasma has been shown to contain an apolipoprotein that mediates the transport of cholesteryl ester from high density lipoprotein (HDL) to very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) or low density lipoprotein (LDL). This activity, confined to the density greater than 1.063 g/ml interval, has been isolated from HDL and appears as a single migrating species by anionic or sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It is unreactive to antibodies to the major HDL apolipoproteins. Antibodies prepared against this factor and immobilized on Sepharose remove the capacity of HDL and density greater than 1.21 g/ml fractions as well as whole plasma to transport cholesteryl ester from HDL. The system shows saturation kinetics with respect to plasma LDL and VLDL concentrations, and transport of cholesteryl ester was associated with reciprocal and equimolar back-transport of triglyceride from VLDL and LDL to the HDL fraction. The possible relationship of this apoprotein to apoprotein D is discussed.",
    "output": "The density interval in which the apolipoprotein activity that mediates the transport of cholesteryl ester is confined is greater than 1.063 g/ml. This means that the activity is found in plasma fractions with a density higher than 1.063 g/ml."

In one patient, this lipoprotein accounted for about 85% of the LDL, but in the second, the amount varied from about 85% to a point at which it could not be detected among the coexisting normal lipoproteins. 4. The protein moiety of this anomalous LDL has effectively the same amino acid composition as that derived from the LDL of healthy subjects. 5. The proportions of carbohydrate, phospholipid and fatty acids could not be reliably distinguished from those of normal LDL. 6. The molecular weight and diffusion constant of the abnormal lipoprotein, even in the purest preparation, were close to the values determined for normal LDL of similar flotation rate.",

    "input": "The effects of lipolysis of human plasma very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) on the structure and composition of high density lipoproteins (HDL) have been investigated. Lipolysis was performed in a controlled system in vitro containing VLDL (d less than 1.006 g/ml) and HDL3 (d = 1.125-1.210 g/ml) from human plasma and lipoprotein lipase (EC 3.1.1.34) purified from bovine milk. Lipolysis of VLDL caused profound changes in HDL3. Protein, phospholipid, and cholesterol liberated from VLDL during its lipolysis were transferred to the HDL3 particles. As a consequence of this in vitro transfer, the chemical composition and biophysical properties of HDL3 were substantially altered. The newly formed particles exhibited a flotation rate (F01.20) of 6.7 and a hydrated density of 1.110 g/ml. The chemical composition closely resembled that of native HDL2, and their size was slightly larger than that of the precursor HDL3. When HDL3 and postlipolysis HDL2 were subjected to ultracentrifugation under flotation velocity and equilibrium conditions, both proved to be stable particles. These results, when extrapolated to in vivo conditions, suggest an important metabolic relationship between the levels of circulating VLDL and HDL2 in plasma. This relationship now permits a reasonable explanation for numerous in vivo observations in which the levels of VLDL and HDL2 change reciprocally.",

In about one third of the cases, there is a manifestation of extrathoracic metastases already at the commencement of therapy. 3. Significant X-ray therapy depends on a) radiosensibility of the tumor to X-rays, b) the site and extent of the tumor. Although limited in its application, radiotherapy does not only improve the situation of the patient but also leads to a regression or temporary X-ray induced standstill of the growth of the tumor.

    "input": "Patients with tumors which appear localized at diagnosis frequently develop metastases after primary definitive therapy. This suggests that occult (microscopic) dissemination of tumor has occurred prior to presentation. This is optimally treated early with chemotherapy after primary definitive treatment. The rationale for this approach is based on cytokinetic studies: micrometastases are more sensitive to anticancer agents thatn larger primary tumors from which they were derived and treatment administered when the tumor burden is at its nadir avoids the necessity to escalate doses and affect host tolerance. The application of these concepts to clinical practice has resulted in significant increases in survivals. Investigations to facilitate early detection of clinical metastases and the integrated use of multidisciplinary treatment for eradication of metastases are outlined.",
    "output": "The optimal timing for treating occult dissemination of tumor with chemotherapy is immediately after primary definitive treatment. This approach is based on cytokinetic studies that show micrometastases, which are small clusters of cancer cells that have spread beyond the primary tumor site, are more sensitive to anticancer agents compared to larger primary tumors. Treating at this stage avoids the need to escalate doses and minimizes host toxicity. This strategy has led to significant increases in survival rates.

    "input": "A statistically highly significant elevation of serum ACE was found in a group of 58 patients with sarcoidosis (serum ACE was elevated in 34% of patients), as compared with normal controls and patients with tuberculosis and various other common diseases. The results suggest that serum ACE is a useful aid for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis when elevated, but that a normal value does not rule out the condition and may occur in more than one-half of monitored patients. There is a trend to diminution of serum ACE with increasing duration of disease with or without steroid therapy, perhaps correlating with the total body mass of active granulomas, as indirectly suggested in preliminary data by correlation of serum ACE with  serum globulin in 16 sarcoidosis patients. It is not yet clear whether there is any significant steroid effect on serum ACE, but a significant number of patients on steroid therapy for more than 2-4 yr have elevated serum ACE values, which in some instances are extremely high. There was a 12-fold elevation in ACE to specific activities generally exceeding those of normal lung in granulomatous lymph nodes of 14 patients with sarcoidosis, suggesting that sarcoid granulomas may be actively synthesizing ACE and resulting in elevation of serum ACE. Extensively fibrotic sarcoid lymph nodes had normal or slightly elevated ACE, suggesting that obliteration of granulomas in sarcoid lymph nodes diminishes their ACE content and that this obliteration may be related to the tendency to diminution of serum ACE with time. ACE was not elevated in one tuberculous lymph node or in experimental granulomas, suggesting that elevation of ACE may have some specificity for the granuloma of sarcoidosis rather than being a characteristic of all granulomas. The catalytic and physical properties of ACE in serum and lymph nodes in sarcoidosis were generally similar to normal ACE with respect to pH activity, modulators, polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, and Sephadex G-200 gel filtration. However, sarcoid lymph node ACE appeared to be more heat labile than normal lung or lymph node ACE, suggesting the possibility that an abnormal ACE may be present in sarcoidosis. If an abnormal enzyme is indeed present, it might be coded for by a host gene that is not normally expressed or a nonhost gene or it might be a normal ACE that has been altered. No ACE activity was found in circulating white blood cells in sarcoidosis or in control subjects, suggesting that circulating white blood cells may not contain the epithelioid cell precursor or that ACE synthesis (or less likely, uptake) may be turned on at a later stage in the transformation. Lysozyme activity was also elevated in sarcoid lymph nodes.

Enzyme activity greater in male control subjects than in female subjects of comparable age and greater in children than in adults. Serum ACE was significantly reduced in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease, lung cancer, tuberculosis and cystic fibrosis, as compared to control subjects, and was even lower in those receiving corticosteroids.

Elevation of ACE levels in sarcoidosis appears to be associated with the active disease process and  does not appear to be a familial inherited enzyme abnormality. An assay of serum ACE is a useful tool for regulating therapy in sarcoidosis and for confirming the diagnosis, since it readily distinguishes these patients from others with tuberculosis, lung cancer or lymphoma.",

After subdivision into diagnostically well defined groups, these patients were compared with 79 normal controls. Most of the diseases investigated were found to follow the \"plasma-type\" pattern. In some of them the deviations from normal were so extensive that a CSF-protein pattern similar to the \"acute-phase reaction\" in the serum occurred. Moreover, the following characteristics were found: a considerable increase in total protein and the gamma-globulin fractions in neurinomas; a reproducible increase in the alpha1-globulins in metastases of the central nervous system; and a statistically significant difference of CSF protein findings between male and female patients with protrusion of lumbar intervertebral discs.",

The mean alpha-2-M level was 341 +/- 14 mg/dl compared with 231 +/- 8 mg/dl in normal persons (p less than 0.01). In a comparable group of alcoholics with laboratory evidence of hepatic dysfunction the mean alpha-2-M level was 208 +/- 10 mg/dl. Although the serum immunoglobulin M content was also substantially elevated in the narcotic-addict group, no correlation was obtained between the serum content of this protein and alpha-2-M.

Wilson's disease is first of all a liver disease and the authors emphasize the fact that cirrhosis is usually present when neurologic symptoms, revealing the disease in 5 cases, appear, even if there is no clinical or biological evidence for liver disease. In one instance hemolytic anemia and chronic active hepatitis were observed at clinical onset. Copper metabolism usually gives the key for diagnosis but its interpretation may be difficult, a normal serum ceruleoplasmin level being found in two patients and evaluated at 6% in the literature. This fact brings up the puzzling question of the pathogesis of the disease. Wilson's disease is not a simple ceruleoplasmin synthesis defect, but a lysosomal disease responsible for the lack of copper biliary excretion. This is pointed out by histochemical studies using a special rubeanic acid preparation (revealing copper deposit on the biliary side of the hepatic cell), and by electron microscopy showing lysosomal dystrophy.",

Electron microscopy showed aggregates of glycogen granules surrounded by a well-defined membrane, as in previously reported cases of type II glycogenosis. Enzymatic study disclosed that acid alpha-glucosidase was deficient in muscle, liver, and heart tissue, although neutral alpha-glucosidase was present within normal ranges.

The picture of a type II abnormality in the infant is very standard: early onset, often neonatally; the association with asystole and muscular hypotonia and a characteristics clinical picture; invariable cardiomegaly and typical ECG findings (short PR interval, high voltage complexes). Death occurs before one year of age, treatment has limited effect, and attention is centred on the early discovery of heterozygotes and of diagnosis antenatally. The possibility of an obstructive type (4 out of 24) and a type with endocardial fibroelastosis (3 out of 24) must be emphasised. In the late onset myopathic form of type II disorder (3 cases), involvement of the myocardium is always found, but is of secondary importance in determining the clinical picture and natural history.

Biochemical investigations of muscle and liver samples confirmed this diagnosis, disclosing an acid maltase deficiency. Glycogen filled lysosomes were also revealed electron optically in skin fibroblasts but not in white blood cells. The literature concerning the late onset forms of acid maltase deficiency (type II glycogenosis) has been reviewed, and the clinical course has been compared with that of the infantile form (Pompe's disease). In early infancy the disease has a short and fatal course, with involvement of many organs. primarily skeletal muscules, liver and heart. In the late infantile and juvenile forms the course of the disease is slower, the organ involvement beeing not as severe; muscular symptoms begin to prevail. In adults, type II glycogenosis mimics muscular dystrophy with its prolonged course and the almost exclusive clinical involvement of proximal muscles.

Detection of cloned recombinant DNA molecules was based on the insertional inactivation of the Tc gene occurring at the unique BamHI cleavage site present in the vector plasmid. Thirty individual clones of the collection were shown to hybridize specifically with a B. subtilis rRNA probe. CCC-recombinant plasmids extracted from E. coli were pooled in lots of 100 and used to transform auxotrophic mutants of B. subtilis 168. Complementation of these auxotrophic mutations was observed for several markers such at thr, leuA, hisA, glyB and purB.

The genetic and molecular properties of plasmids mini-F, ColE1, and RK2 are described with particular emphasis on the origin and direction of replication and the identification of genetic regions essential for maintenance of these elements in the extra-chromosomal state. Low molecular weight derivatives of each of these plasmids have been obtained and a restriction enzyme map determined for these various derivatives. A hybrid DNA molecule consisting of a low molecular weight derivative of ColE1 joined to a segment of bacteriophage DNA has been constructed and shown to be capable of existing either as a plasmid element or packaged as an infectious viral particle.

    "input": "1. The effect was studied of various conditioning stimuli on the threshold of single C-fibers near their spinal terminals. Spikes were recorded in L6 and L7 dorsal root ganglia of cats. A stimulating electrode in the superficial dorsal horn delivered periodic pulses whose widths were adjusted automatically to near threshold for antidromic spike production. Most units were classified according to their adequate cutaneous stimuli, as C-mechanoreceptors, high-threshold mechanoreceptors, or polymodal nociceptors. 2. Orthodromic activity in all units increased their threshold for up to several minutes; the maximum and rate of decay depended on the amount of activity. This phenomenon parallels the hyperpolarizing afterpotential of C-fibers in peripheral nerve and, we suggest, is probably due to the aftereffect of impulses. 3. Cutaneous conditioning stimuli were applied for 10-20 s near the receptive fields of tested units, but without activating them. During the brushing of skin hair, all threshold changes were decreases; during pinching most changes were increases; during noxious heating the numbers of increases and decreases were similar. It will be necessary to analyze the responses of postsynaptic cells in order to know the physiological significance of these threshold changes. 4. Stimulation in the nucleus raphe magnus caused in half the units higher intraspinal thresholds. If this result is causally related to the previously reported inhibition of neuronal responses in the dorsal horn by the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM), then increased thresholds could reflect either direct presynaptic inhibition or facilitation of inhibitory connections. 5. No correlation between receptive-field classification and the response of terminals to natural cutaneous stimulation or stimulation of the NRM could be discovered. However, the terminals of all kinds of C-fibers differ from A-fibers in their reaction to noxious cutaneous and NRM stimulation, suggesting they are subject to a different system of control.",

Results obtained were contingent on the level of focal activity present at the time of stimulation. Very active foci (spike rates above 0.5/sec) were uniformly driven by stimulation of all structures under study. Foci exhibiting weak to moderate levels of activity were, on the other hand, inhibited both during and following stimulation. Episodes of spike suppression induced through stimulation of diffusely projecting structures were typically followed by an intensified \"rebound\" of interictal activity. Episodes of suppression induced through stimulation of regions of limited projection were not followed by such rebounds, an effect most dramatically apparent with caudate stimulation and motor cortex foci. Results are discussed in terms of the interaction between naturally occurring brain rhythms in sleep and arousal with the epileptic process.",
    "output": "When foci exhibiting weak to moderate levels of activity were stimulated, they were inhibited both during and following the stimulation. This means that the electrical stimulation had a suppressive effect on these foci. Additionally, episodes of spike suppression induced through stimulation of diffusely projecting structures were typically followed by an intensified \"rebound\" of interictal activity. However, episodes of suppression induced through stimulation of regions of limited projection, such as the caudate, were not followed by such rebounds.

Cerebellar stimulation produced EPSPs only in a few PN cells. 4. Activation of the corticopontine or pyramidal tract produced in all PN cells an EPSP built up from the unitary components with variable amplitudes and time courses.

A great majority of these spontaneous EPSPs were cerebral in origin, and had amplitudes and time courses comparable with those evoked by stimulation of the corticopontine or pyramidal tract. 6.

Responses of the cells to electrical stimulation of the raphe nuclei and nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) were measured. 2. LC stimulation caused a long latency, 30-100 msec, and long duration, 100-300 msec cessation of spontaneous activity of most recorded neurones. When bursting-type neurones were recorded, the stimulation occasionally caused a synchronized repetitive bursting firing pattern. 3. Pre-treatment with drugs which interfere with catecholamine neurotransmission, i.e. reserpine and 6OHDA, prevented the appearance of cellular responses to LC stimulation. 4. Stimulation of the dorsal or the median raphe nuclei generated more complex and less clear-cut responses. These included several types of long (20-50 msec) and short (2-5 msec) latency responses. These responses were also accompanied in some cells by synchronized repetitive bursting. 5. Interference with serotonin neurotransmission with PPCA or reserpine reduced the detection of long latency responses. 6. Short latency responses accompanied by evoked field potentials were recorded also after stimulation of dorsal tegmental nucleus. 7. Rates of spontaneous firing cells were augmented after monoamine neurotransmission interruption whereas after fornix lesion, when there is supposedly an increased monoamine innervation of the septum, cells fire at lower rates than normal. 8. It is suggested that noradrenaline and serotonin may serve as neurotransmitters in the medial-septum-diagonal band areas.",

PT cells were conditioned by antidromic trains (10--50 cps for 4--15 s) and by paired PT and VL stimuli with different intervals and sequences. The VL-EPSPs were examined before and after conditioning, to find differences in efficacy in giving rise to spikes. The conditioning procedures resulted in a remarkable facilitation of VL-EPSPs, manifesting itself as a significant rise of efficacy in generating spikes, a shortening of peak latency and in some cases, an enhancement of background firing. 2. In non-PT neurons the same conditioning procedures elicited heterosynaptic facilitation and a rise in firing activity. 3. Intracellularly injected square wave pulses also resulted in facilitation of VL-EPSPs. 4. Pairings of PT and VL stimuli were more effective than trains in evoking conditioned changes. 5. Plastic modifications were observed in the 13.7% of the neurons subjected to conditioning procedures. 6.

With increased frequency of the stimulating current there was an increase in the number of responding elements and in the reactivity of neurones. The conditioning stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus increased the pronouncement and duration of hippocampal unit responses to sound stimuli.

The purpose of these experiments was to compare effects of electrical stimuli applied in two regions of the brain stem that are the sites of origin of descending bulbospinal systems; namely, the nucleus gigantocellularis of Brodal (7) and the nucleus raphe magnus, on the responses of lumbosacral spinothalamic neurons to mechanical stimuli. 2. In cats anesthetized with alpha-chloralose, stimulating in either of these structures with single pulses of current while the spinothalamic neuron was tonically activated by a sustained mechanical pressure resulted in an increase in the excitability of the cell followed by a prolonged suppression of its impulse activity. 3. For different neurons, the latency of the excitation ranged from 4 to 18 ms following the brain stem stimulus, while the latency of the suppression ranged from 16 to 34 ms. 4. In general, the effects of stimulating in the reticular formation and in the raphe nuclei were similar. although quantitative differences were found in the effects of each on different spinothalamic neurons. On the basis of these two studies, it is argued that the reticulospinal and raphe-spinal systems exert qualitatively similar effects on the responses of spinothalamic neurons evaluated in this experiment. 5. A comparison of the magnitudes of the suppression phase evoked from several different sites in the ipsilateral reticular formation and nucleus raphe magnus suggests that the descending systems arising from both these structures may be quite heterogeneous. 6. Stimulation of both regions of the brain stem produced a much greater suppression of the response of the spinothalamic neurons to slowly changing or sustained mechanical stimuli than to transient stimuli. It is suggested that the effects of descending systems arising both in the raphe nuclei and in the reticular formation on the responses of spinothalamic neurons to a mechanical stimulus are at least as dependent on the time course of the mechanical stimulus as they are on its intensity.",

The neurons were identified by antidromic activation from the contralateral diencephalon. They were then classified by the mildest form of mechanical stimulation applied to the ipsilateral hindlimb. The effects of electrical stimulation of the nerve(s) supplying the receptive field were investigated. Graded electrical stimulation revealed that the threshold responses of spinothalamic tract neurons excited by weak mechanical stimuli occurred when the largest afferent fibers were activated. On the other hand, neurons that required intense mechanical stimulation for their excitation tended to have higher thresholds to electrical stimulation. Some spinothalamic tract cells were shown to receive monosynaptic excitatory connections from peripheral nerve fibers, although polysynaptic connections may generally be more important. An input from unmyelinated afferent fibers was demonstrated. It is concluded the primate spinothalamic tract neurons receive a rich convergent input from a variety of cutaneous receptors. The experiments provide some evidence for the most likely types of receptors.",

By a number of parameters the excitatory response of the units may be divided into several individual reactions which set in at different time periods and are apparently of different nature. It is assumed that the short-latency responses are to a considerable degree due to excitatory input to the units along intracortical pathways. Excitatory responses with a 20 to 40 ms latency, appearing at a period of the so-called inhibitory pause, and postinhibitory excitatory responses reveal a considerable dependence on the input from the subcortical formations, activated in a secondary way by the stimulus applied to the cortex.",
    "output": "The assumed cause of the short-latency responses in the excitatory response of the units, as stated in the context, is to a considerable degree due to excitatory input to the units along intracortical pathways. This means that the rapid responses are thought to be primarily the result of direct connections between neurons within the same region of the cortex. However, it's important to note that this is an assumption based on the observations made in the study, and further research might be needed to confirm this hypothesis."

    "input": "1. In locally anesthetized cats, extracellular recordings were made from single neurons in the lateral cruciate gyrus of cerebral cortex. These neurons responded to natural activation of stretch receptors in single, contralateral, forelimb wrist muscles, typically with phasic excitation. Low-velocity stretches, which activate primary endings of muscle spindles, excited one set of neurons at a mean latency of 11 ms; high-velocity stretches, which principally activate Golgi tendon organs and/or secondary spindle endings, excited a second set at 18 ms. The cortical neurons showing threshold responses to low-velocity stretches were found exclusively within restricted columns, 0.5-2.0 mm in diameter, which were spatially separate for each muscle. Neurons exhibiting threshold responses to high-velocity stretches were present in high density within the same columns and were also distributed, although more sparsely, outside the columns. 2. These afferent columns were located in cytoarchitectonic area 4gamma, and were shown by intracortical microstimulation to coincide with the efferent columns for contraction of the same muscle from which in input rose. Discrete afferent columns were also found for single muscles in the peridimple region of sensory cortex (area 3a), spatially separate from the columns in motor cortex. The excitation of the columns in motor cortex by these inputs from muscle was independent of that in sensory cortex. 3. The role of the cerebellum in controlling these feedback systems to motor cortex was investigated by selective cooling of interpositus and dentate nucleus, respectively. Cooling of interpositus markedly reduced transmission in the high-threshold system; cooling of dentate had a similar effect on the low-threshold system. 4. The latency, threshold, and cooling data indicated that the low-threshold system to motor cortex utilizes extracerebellar pathways including medial lemniscus and is facilitated by dentate nucleus. The high-threshold system involves a transcerebellar pathway including interpositus nucleus. Both systems transmit velocity-related information, with each showing different and complementary sensitivity and dynamic range. 5. The results are discussed with reference to the cortical load-compensation mechanism postulated by Phillips (37-38).",

For comparison, similar tests were done with seven tetracycline analogues, two polymyxins, chloramphenicol, and spectinomycin. Tobramycin compared favorably with the more active aminoglycosides, with some exceptions related to individual strains of species. The tetracyclines and chloramphenicol were generally less active than the more active aminoglycosides.

It was considerably more stable than cephaloridine or cephalothin to the beta-lactamases produced by Escherichia coli (RP1), Klebsiella aerogenes K1 and Enterobacter cloacae P99. Concentrations of cefuroxime much greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were usually necessary to induce lysis of beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producers. In contrast, cephaloridine, cephalothin and ampicillin were rapidly bacteriolytic at, or near, the respective MIC against non-beta-lactamase producers, whereas the activity of these three antibiotics was considerably reduced against beta-lactamase-producing strains.",

The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the three penicillins were very similar and the compounds were active against non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella species, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Streptococci including Streptococcus faecalis, and non-beta-lactamase-producing staphylococci were also sensitive to the compounds but Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus species were resistant. At concentrations close to MIC value epicillin and ampicillin showed similar bactericidal activity against E. coli and against S. typhi and both compounds caused a slower rate of kill than was seen with amoxycillin. Microscopical observation of the cells exposed to ampicillin and epicillin for 1 h showed the presence of filamentous forms which lysed slowly, whereas cells exposed to amoxycillin for the same period rapidly. Epicillin was similar to or slightly less active than ampicillin against experimental mouse infections, and against the majority of infections both compounds were significantly less effective than amoxycillin by the oral and subcutaneous routes of administration.",

Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against kanamycin or gentamicin were greater than 50 microgram/ml, whereas ampicillin or penicillin inhibitory concentrations were uniformly less than 0.1 microgram/ml. Although all strains had bactericidal concentrations (MBC) less than 0.1 microgram penicillin/ml, penicillin at a concentration equal to each strains respective MBC reduced inoculum colony forming units (CFU) 2 logs in only 6 of 16 strains in bactericidal kinetic studies. However, the addition of gentamicin in concentrations of 5.0 or 10.0 microgram/ml to penicillin markedly enhanced bactericidal activity in all strains tested. The addition of lower concentrations of gentamicin (1.0 microgram/ml) had minimal advantage over penicillin alone. No distinct advantage was noted for combinations including either ampicillin or kanamycin. The theoretical advantage of penicillin-aminoglycoside combinations in experimental conditions, suggests that the use of antibiotic combinations in clinical infections due to Group B streptococci, may result in a more rapid eradication of these organisms.",

However, when higher concentrations of gentamicin (5.0 or 10.0 microgram/ml) were added to penicillin, there was a marked enhancement of bactericidal activity in all strains tested.

Both the minimal inhibitory concentration and the minimal bacteridical concentration were determined. Overall, tobramycin seemed the most effective of the drugs studied. Netilmicin, the new derivative from sisomicin, compared favourably with the other drugs tested, but may, on theoretical grounds, offer the additional advantage of retained efficacy in the face of developing bacterial resistance. Not unexpectedly, amikacin appeared to be the most promising of the drugs studied in its action against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Amikacin and netilmicin appeared to be the most effective of this group of antibiotics against Klebsiella species.",

As a rule, penicillin proved to be more active against penicillin-sensitive strains of micro-organisms than ampicillin and nafcillin and far more so than cloxacillin. In combination with di-hydrostreptomycin, which in itself showed hardly any activiy, the activity of penicillin against streptococci was enhanced considerably. This confirms the synergistic effect of this combination. No clear synergism was noted in the activity against staphylococci. Against strains which were less sensitive to penicillin, there was not much difference in activity between penicillin, ampicillin, nafcillin and cloxacillin. Nafcillin was found to be much more active against streptococci than cloxacillin. The anti-staphylococcal activities of these two antibiotics however were identical. The activity of the combination of penicillin, dihydrostreptomycin and nafcillin against most micro-organisms was mainly due to the penicillin in the combination. Against Streptococcus agalactiae and the most penicillin-resistant staphylococci, nafcillin contributed clearly to the activity. The activity of the combination ampicillin + cloxacillin against Streptococcus agalactiae was mainly based on the activity of the ampicillin in the combination. Against penicillin-resistant staphylococci, the activity of the combination was mainly due to the activity of cloxacillin. Against the other micro-organisms, both compounds contributed to the activity of the combination.",

It is becoming increasingly clear that besides traditional immunosuppressive agents, an array of miscellaneous influences and conditions, as well as drugs used for other purposes, can affect the immune system. The potential pathogenetic role of immunity in an ever growing number of diseases, including infections, cancer, and autoimmune processes, confers on the concept of concomitant immunosuppression or immunotoxicology its due place in the discipline of immunopharmacology. 2. Microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoa (and their products), as well as parasites, may depress immune reactivity. The mechanism of action, dose-response dependency, effect of timing, and relation to bacterial adjuvanticity need more thorough exploration. 3. The efficacy of immunosuppressive drug protocols can be improved by combining immunosuppressants without bone marrow toxicity, such as niridazole or free fatty acids, with the standard antiproliferative immunosuppressive agents. 4. Prostaglandin is a likely candidate for an essential role as an immunosuppressive effector. Its release from T-suppressor cells is triggered for example by microorganisms. Moreover, dietetic and metabolic factors, such as free fatty acids, and nervous impulses affect prostaglandin formation.

Numerous techniques, both direct and indirect, have now been described to identify immune complexes in serum, though no single technique will identify regularly immune complexes in all clinical situations, nor will it demonstrate the pathogenicity of the immune complex in a given patient. Human disorders with a definite immune complex basis (glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis) and others with a possible immune complex basis (e.g. cutaneous vasculitis, are presented.

It is probable that similar immunoregulatory influences play a key role in maintaining tolerance to some self-antigens. Thus, despite the presence of cells potentially capable of reacting to autologous antigens, lack of autoimmunity might reflect either an absence of amplifying or a preponderance of suppressive immunoregulatory forces.

    "input": "Macrophages serve an essential but poorly understood role in the cellular and molecular events that underlie immune competence. Antigenic proteins are now known to bind initially to macrophages prior to their recognition by T lymphocytes. Antigen uptake by macrophages is a metabolism-dependent event that results in an association of the antigen or a fragment thereof with a product of genes linked to the major histocompatibility complex of the species. For recognition of this associative form of antigen and self to result in cell proliferation, a direct physical interaction of antigen-bearing macrophage and lumphocyte must occur. Soluble forms of the altered antigen complexed to self may, however, function in nonproliferative T cell activation phenomenon. Using antigens of defined structure, it is possible to derive data which indicate that genetic control of immune responsiveness resides at the level of the antigen-presenting cell, thus indicating that these latter cells have profound discriminatory influences on host immune competence.",

    "input": "The specific binding of antigens by antibodies leads to the development of antigen-antibody-complexes. Apart from the connected with this and desirable immunological protection immune complexes, however, may also have an pathogenic effect on certain conditions (e. g. transmission of the capacity of phagocytosis), depositing themselves in the vascular regions concerned, activating complement and after binding to cell membranes causing the release of unspecific mediators. Finally these lead through increased vascular permeability, local ischaemia and hyperaemia, respectively, and the release of proteolytic enzymes to a lesion of the tissues. In a series of in most cases chronic inflammatory diseases depositions of immune complexes may be proved in the tissues concerned. However, it is difficult to establish exactly in the individual case, whether they considerably participated in the development of the clinical picture. By analogies to experimentally produced immune complex diseases at least some entities of diseases (e. g. lupus erythematodes disseminatus) or defined local alterations of the tissues (e. g. glomerulonephritis of immune complex type) may be defined pathogenetically.",
    "output": "An example of a disease that may be defined pathogenetically by analogies to experimentally produced immune complex diseases is Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, SLE). This autoimmune disorder is characterized by the formation of immune complexes that deposit in various tissues, leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and a series of symptoms such as skin rashes, joint pain, and kidney problems. The pathogenesis of SLE is thought to involve the deposition of antigen-antibody complexes, complement activation, and the release of inflammatory mediators, similar to the process described in the context. Other examples could include immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, which is a type of kidney inflammation caused by the deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli."

Pulmonary alveolar macrophages represent a common effector pathway for both nonspecific cellular phagocytic defenses and for specifically triggered cell-mediated immunity, via T lymphocytes. Nonspecific activation of macrophages is induced by toxic substances. Studies of the immunocytologic system indicate partial compartmentalization and \"local\" immunity for both cellular and humoral systems. Further studies on pulmonary cell-mediated immunity have characterized an amplification mechanism by which antigen-induced stimulation of T lymphocytes leads to recruitment of nonsensitive lymphocytes through the production of a low-molecular weight \"transfer factor.\" Other lymphocyte-produced mediators (lymphokines) act to attract, aggregate and accumulate macrophages in areas of inflammation. In addition, macrophages are \"activated\" and show enhanced microbicidal capabilities as well as enhanced resistance to the cytotoxic effects of certain ingested microorganisms. It is postulated that cellular (nonspecific) and cell-mediated (specific) immune defenses play important roles in protection against several categories of microorganisms in a hierarchy of virulence.",
    "output": "The lung uses a combination of excretory transport mechanisms, cellular defense systems (such as pulmonary alveolar macrophages), and humoral defense systems to defend against infections, toxins, and allergens. Pulmonary alveolar macrophages are key effector cells in both nonspecific cellular phagocytic defenses and specific cell-mediated immunity. They can be activated by toxic substances and by antigens to recruit other lymphocytes, produce low-molecular weight \"transfer factors\" for amplification, and attract, aggregate, and accumulate macrophages in areas of inflammation through the production of lymphokines. This combined action helps protect the lung against a variety of microorganisms, with cellular (nonspecific) and cell-mediated (specific) immune defenses playing important roles in this protection."

    "input": "Current hypotheses regarding the pathophysiology of rheumatic disease are depicted in Figure 1. Susceptible individuals, when exposed to microorganisms and/or drugs, can start the events depicted in Figure 1; the ability of the individual to respond to these exogenous agents is influenced by genetic factors including inherited deficiencies of the host's immune defense mechanisms. Microorganisms may then infect and/or effect mononuclear cells with persistence, or may be activated by environmental factors including UV light or other infections. If cell lysis results, antibodies can then be made to the cell (lymphocytotoxic antibodies) or cell products (ANA, etc.). The antibodies-to-lymphocyte membranes may interfere with lymphocyte function in a number of ways, including immunosuppression, and may also cause reactivation of this cycle. The antibodies may combine with antigens to form immune complexes that can be efficiently cleared by macrophages, have a feedback role in lymphocyte regulation, or in susceptible individuals deposit in tissue with subsequent inflammation. All or some of these steps or pathways may be under the influence of genetic factors.",
    "output": "The antibodies that can be made to cell products as a result of cell lysis include lymphocytotoxic antibodies and antibodies against nuclear antigens (ANA, etc.). These antibodies are produced by the immune system in response to the presence of cellular debris following cell lysis. The lymphocytotoxic antibodies specifically target the membranes of lymphocytes, while ANA and other antibodies are directed against specific cellular components such as nucleic acids or proteins. The formation of these antibodies can contribute to the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases by interfering with lymphocyte function, forming immune complexes, and depositing in tissue with subsequent inflammation."

Up to 50% of the sheep in some flocks were found to shed eggs. The adults, sporocysts, \"slime balls\" and cercariae of D. hospes are described and compared to the respective stages of D. dendriticum. This comparison shows that essential morphological structures are very similar, especially the sensory papillae, which as so called chaetotaxis can serve to distinguish closely related species. The cercariae develop in terrestrial snails of the genus Limicolaria of which several species may play a role (L. flammea, L. felina, L. kambeul). The main habitat of D. hospes seems to be limited to savannah environment; only once could D. hospes be found in the borderzone between savannah and the rain forest. Infected Limicolaria-snails shed the cercariae in amorphous \"slime balls\" of liquid-jelly-like consistency and yellowish colour. Under the influence of sunlight these liquify; the cercariae, however, can survive for up to 26 h. According to our present knowledge the sunlight seems to be a factor which triggers the shedding of slime balls. This begins shortly after sunrise at a temperature of 22 degrees C and a relative humidity of 100%. Infected snails can shed cercariae on seven consecutive days. This kind of slime ball production might provide a clue to the 2nd intermediate host; efforts to identify this host have, however, so far been fruitless, despite the fact that almost 4000 arthropods, mainly ants, have been investigated.",

The former category includes cysticercosis, echinococcosis, and trichinosis, the latter category covers various trematode, cestode, nematode, and possibly also protozoan infections. Examples of trematode infections are heterophyidiasis, transmitted to man by marine fish, and Paragonimus spp parasites, transmitted by crustaceans. Cestode infections include diphyllobothriasis transmitted by both fresh water fish and fish from brackish waters. Special attention is drawn to the condition known as sparganosis.

As was also the case in previous studies, S. typhi murium (27.5 per cent), S. panama (22.2 per cent) and S. brandenburg (9.2 per cent) were the three serotypes most frequently isolated. The three most frequently isolated phage types of S. typhi murium were II 505 (62.1 per cent), II 502 (5.3 per cent) and I 650 (4.2 per cent). The serotypes and phage types were present in nearly all the materials studied which again emphasizes the fact that there are contamination cycles of Salmonella. These studies showed that the route of contamination divides in the butcher's shop. Salmonella ogranisms carried with the meat frome the slaughter-house find their way into the drains on the one hand, and, by meat and meat products, to consumers on the other. Moreover, the high degree of contamination of effluents is not in accordance with the small number of cases of salmonellosis.",

    "input": "After more than thirty years of malaria control in northern Transvaal with residual insecticides, malaria prevalence has been reduced to a low level. However, low-grade transmission of Plasmodium falciparum continues, with periodic focal outbreaks after abnormally high rainfall. From October 1973 to September 1976, the operational and epidemiological factors involved in this residual transmission were studied in over 17 000 people of an area of northern Transvaal. Incidence surveys based on the screening of fever cases revealed 42 autochthonous cases of malaria in 1974-75 and 10 cases in 1975-76. Parasite prevalence surveys were not sensitive enough to assess the malaria situation, and serological testing indicated different levels of infection according to the method used. One of the two principal vectors of malaria in Africa-Anopheles funestus Giles-was not detected in the project area, and the A. gambiae group (species A and B) was found in extremely low numbers, so that it could not have accounted for the low-grade transmission in the area. A recently discovered member of the A. funestus group somewhat resembling A. aruni Sobti, and a species hitherto undiscovered in the Transvaal, which is abundant in the area and is indistinguishable from A. flavicosta Edwards, may be involved. Both were found biting man-mostly outdoors during the four hours following dusk, when people frequently gather outside their houses and are thus vulnerable to mosquito bites.",

    "input": "Intracranial heterotransplantation in the nude, athymic mouse has been found to be an effective method for the experimental growth of human malignant lymphomas. Transplants of 11 primary lymphomas and six derived cell lines yielded a high take rate (90%) and a low mean latent period (36 days). Relatively small inocula produced extensive intracerebral infiltrates which could be identified as human in origin by immunofluorescence. Although confined to the central nervous system and meninges, the tumors were highly invasive and displayed morphologic features strikingly similar to those of the original primary tumors. Heterotransplantation of the lymphomas to extracranial sites was only rarely successful. Nude mice previously grafted with isologous neonatal thymuses failed to develop intracerebral tumors. Secondary cell cultures successfully established from several of the intracranial heterotransplants were found to be infected with NIH type-C xenotropic virus. The distinctive growth patterns and other neuropathologic features of the heterotransplants are described, and the relevance of these observations to the development of intracerebral lymphomas in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients is noted. This method of studying human malignant lymphomas in vivo may permit better histopathologic characterization of the tumors, and may serve as a basis for further experimental lines of investigation, including viral, immunologic, and therapeutic studies.",
    "output": "The mean latent period for the growth of human malignant lymphomas in the nude, athymic mouse, as per the provided context, is 36 days. This refers to the time it takes for the tumors to become identifiable after transplantation into the mouse's central nervous system and meninges."

    "instruction": "What percentage of tumors registered were keratinized and nonkeratinized squamous cell carcinomas?",
    "input": "The aim of the experiments was to determine whether the various types of carcinomas found in the human urinary bladder were reproducible in animals. We added n-butyl-n-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day to the drinking water of 177 female Wistar rats for a period of 40 to 150 days. After a total experimental time of between 150 and 250 days the animals were sacrified. The spectrum of carcinomas induced, includes all the types known to occur in man. The various tumor types occurred with the same frequency as in man and exhibited the same growth patterns. Variously differentiated papillary and non-papillary transitional cell carcinomas comprised 88.8% of tumors registered. 5.1% were keratinized and nonkeratinized squamous cell carcinomas, 2.2% adenocarcinomas. 1.1% were undifferentiated carcinomas and 2.8% were carcinomas of the mixed type with squamous cell and transitional cell differentiation. Histogenetically adenocarcinomas were found to originate from glandular metaplasia and squamous cell carcinomas from squamous metaplasia within completely developed transitional cell carcinomas. Furthermore it was possible to induce proliferative lesions such as von Brunn's nests, cystitis cystica and cystitis glandularis. However, we found no clues to substantiate the development of adenocarcinomas from these proliferative lesions, or for that matter squamous cell carcinomas from squamous metaplasia of the otherwise unchanged urothelium. The present experimental model seems particulary suited for the search of further information regarding the development of tumors in the human bladder.",

Rats were killed at different times after beginning of carcinogen treatment and tissue specimens were prepared for histologic investigation. Particular interest was placed on the development of tumors and on pathological findings possibly contributing to early diagnosis of stomach cancer. During the development of tumors, several dysplastic reactions were observed in the antral mucosa. They could be classified into 4 groups: One was regenerative hyperplasia (1) that meant irregular glandular proliferations without cell atypism at the margin of erosions and ulcers. This lesion was mainly found 1-9 weeks after administration of MNNG. In glandular hyperplasia (2) either crypts or glands were extended and mucosal layers were thickened. No signs of cell atypism were observed. This lesion was mainly found 12-17 weeks after administration of MNNG. Dysplasia (3) was combined with considerable structural modifications and cellular atypism. However, this lesion was limited to the mucosal layer. Neoplastic changes (4) were characterized by marked cellular atypism and extension to tunica submucosa and tunica serosa. Some tumors showed the histological patterns of benign tumors, but most of them were adenocarcinomas. In some cases metastases into pancreas, liver and lymph nodes and in one case into the 12th rib were observed. No particular enzyme patterns were found by histochemistry.",

    "input": "A total of 33 specimens of human gastric carcinoma were used for transplantation into nude mice. Initital tumor \"take\" was accomplished in 15 of the 33 tumors, and the transplantability rate was 45.5%. Transplantability correlated with histologic type, but not with clinical stage or Borrmann's classification. The transplantability rate of differentiated carcinomas, such as well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, and papillary adenocarcinoma was greater than that of poorly differentiated tumors, such as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and mucinous adenocarcinoma. The growth patterns of transplanted tumors were divided into 3 types: rapid, slow, and persistent. There were no specific relationships between growth pattern and histologic type. All histologic types, except signet ring cell carcinoma, could be transplanted serially. Tumor growth became rapid after serial transfer. However, the original histology of these tumors was unchanged. No invasion or metastases were encountered. Intraperitoneal injection of a tumor cell suspension, prepared from subcutaneous transplants of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of Borrmann type III, grew in an ascites form, with invasion and metastasis. Ascitic fluid accumulated within 3--6 weeks after injection. Subsequently, intravenous injection of ascites fluid produced metastases in nude mice. The histology of the subcutaneous tumor was similar to that of the original tumor from the patient.",

    "input": "In the isolated, perfused rat pancreas, prostaglandins (PGs) E1 and E2 1-5 ng/ml, reduced the vasoconstrictor responses to periarterial nerve stimulation and variably affected those to injected norepinephrine. Prostaglandin F2alpha had no consistent effect on the vasoconstrictor responses to both adrenergic stimuli. Stimulation of adrenergic nerves or administration of norepinephrine released a PGE-like substance from  the perfused pancreas which was abolished by inhibitors of PG synthesis, acetylsalicylic acid, indomethacin, meclofenamate, and eicosa-5,8,11,14-tetraynoic acid. The latter three agents did not potentiate, but rather reduced the vasoconstrictor responses to both adrenergic stimuli. Arachidonic acid that was converted by the pancreas into PGE2 and PGF2alpha inhibited the vasoconstrictor responses to adrenergic stimuli. The latter effect of arachidonic acid was not altered by the simultaneous infusion of PG synthetase inhibitors. Although these results, which could be attributed to a direct effect of inhibitors of PG synthesis and arachidonic acid on adrenergic neuroeffector junction, fail to establish the role of endogenous PGs in modulating adrenergic responses in rat pancreatic vessels, they emphasize the differences in the effect of PGE1 and PGE2 on adrenergic responses in various vascular beds of the rat.",

    "input": "The effects of prostaglandin (PG) E1, E2, A1, F1alpha, F2alpha or D2 on the rat renal cortical, outer medullary and inner medullary adenylate cyclase-cyclic AMP systems were examined. While high concentrations (8X10-4M) of each prostaglandin stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in each area of the kidney, PGE1 was the only prostaglandin to stimulate at 10-7M. PGA's were the only prostaglandins tested besides PGE's which stimulated adenylate cyclase at less than 10-4M. This effect of PGA's was limited to the outer medulla. PGD2 was the least stimulatory. Observations with renal slices yielded qualitatively similar results. The PGE's were the most potent in each area with PGA's only stimulatory in the outer medulla. O2 deprivation (5% O2) lowered the slice cyclic AMP content in each area of the kidney. In the cortex and outer medulla, prostaglandin mediated increases in cyclic AMP content were either lower or absent at 5% O2 compared to 95% O2. However, in the inner medulla PGE stimulation was observed only at 5% O2 and not 95% O2. No other prostaglandins were found to increase inner medullary cyclic AMP content at 95% or 5% O2. These results illustrate that the adenylate cyclase-cyclic AMP system responds uniquely to prostaglandins in each area of the kidney. Consideration of these results along with correlative observations suggests that inner medullary produced PGE's may act as local modulators of inner medullary adenylate cyclase.",
    "output": "The effect of O2 deprivation on prostaglandin-mediated increases in cyclic AMP content in the cortex and outer medulla is a decrease or absence of the effect compared to normal oxygen levels (95% O2). This suggests that adequate oxygen supply is necessary for the full response of these areas to prostaglandin stimulation. In contrast, in the inner medulla, prostaglandin-stimulated increases in cyclic AMP content were observed only under low oxygen conditions (5% O2), indicating a unique response in this area. These findings suggest that the adenylate cyclase-cyclic AMP system responds differently to prostaglandins in each area of the kidney, and that inner medullary PGEs may act as local modulators of inner medullary adenylate cyclase under low oxygen conditions."

Infusion of PGE2 and prostacyclin induced a dose-dependent direct decrease in resistance. Infusion of PGF2 alpha resulted in a dose-dependent difference in response. Infusion of lower doses provoked a decrease in mesenteric vascular resistance, whereas infusion of higher doses resulted in an increase. Lower doses of arachidonic acid induced a gradual decrease in resistance, while higher doses provoked biphasic or triphasic responses.

Pgs were to the greatest part of the F2alpha-type. PgE2 was found in traces only. Neither PgA2, nor the metabolites 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PgF2alpha and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PgE2 were detected in the perfusates. Isoproterenol reduced the PgF2alpha output significantly. This effect was increased by the addition of theophylline. Propranolol did not reverse the effect of isoproterenol, but in a high concentration (5 mug/ml) reduced the PgF2alpha output for its own. Indomethacin completely abolished the anaphylactic prostaglandin release. The histamine liberation was significantly decreased only by the combination of isoproterenol and theophylline, and also by a high concentration of propranolol (5 mug/ml). In contrast to the Pg release, the anaphylactic SRS-A and histamine liberation was not abolished by indomethacin, but rather increased. The results are discussed in view of the possible role of the released substances  in the functional events of cardiac anaphylaxis.",
    "output": "Indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, completely abolished the anaphylactic prostaglandin release in the isolated perfused guinea pig hearts. This suggests that the prostaglandins, particularly of the F2alpha-type, play a significant role in the anaphylactic response of these hearts.

PGI2 (1.25--10 micrograms/kg) decreased blood pressure in a dose-related manner, whereas PGE2 (100--1000 mg/kg) dose-dependently increased blood pressure. Both PGF2 alpha (0.31--20 micrograms/kg) and indomethacin (0.625--40 micrograms/kg) had no effects on blood pressure. These results indicate that intraventricular injection of PGI2 or PGE2 can induce significant changes in blood pressure, while endogenous prostaglandins synthesized in the brain seem to play a minor role in direct regulation of systemic blood pressure in the rat.",
    "output": "The context indicates that intraventricularly administered PGE2 dose-dependently increased systemic blood pressure in conscious rats, while PGI2 decreased it in a dose-related manner.

PGs did not change the testosterone production and the hCG sensitivity of the Leydig cells, nor the LH secretion and the LHRH sensitivity of the anterior pituitary cells. PGE2 at concentrations of 10(-6), 10(-5) and 10(-4) M significantly increased the hypothalamic tissue-induced pituitary-testicular activation, and this stimulatory effect of PGE2 was dose dependent.

The increase in bleeding time and the inhibition of ex vivo platelet aggregation lasted for as long as the infusion of PGI2 was maintained but rapidly disappeared after infusion was stopped. Prostacyclin is a more potent inhibitor of platelet function, in vivo than prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) or prostaglandin D2 (PGD2).

I.v. administration of anti-LH-RH serum 2.5 min prior to the infusion of 2 microgram or 20 microgram of PGE2 significantly inhibited the PGE2-induced rise of plasma LH. Intraventricular infusion of 20 microgram of PGF2alpha or PGF2beta into NRS-pretreated animals caused a marked increase in the plasma LH concentration; whereas, prior i.v. administration of anti-LH-RH serum blocked the PG-induced rise in plasma LH levels.

    "input": "Prostaglandins (PGs) of type F2 alpha, E1, and E2 have been reported both, to inhibit or to facilitate posterior pituitary oxytocin release in lactating animals and women, and to suppress or to stimulate the mammary myoepithelium. Prostaglandin-induced milk ejection in women and cows has been attributed to central oxytocin release, but no oxytocin blood levels were determined. Moreover, for lactating cows, sows, rabbits, guinea pigs, and rats a direct PG effect on the mammary myoepithelium resulting in milk ejection has been suggested. On the other hand, PGs were found to antagonize the milk-ejection response to oxytocin in rabbits and rats. The mechanisms involved in PG synergism or antagonism of oxytocin-induced milk ejection are not understood. Studies in lactating rats showed that blood pressure active PG doses of F2 alpha, E1, and E2 largely inhibited the intramammary pressure response to oxytocin. Whereas the oxytocin-antagonistic action of PGF2 alpha was not affected by adrenergic blockers (phenoxybenzamine, propranolol), the anti-oxytocin effects of PGE1 and E2 were eliminated after alpha-receptor blockade while the activity of oxytocin increased. Under beta-receptor or alpha- plus beta-receptor blockade, the oxytocin-inhibitory effects of PGE1 and E2 were almost abolished. Mechanisms of PG-induced inhibition of the oxytocin response may involve mammary vascular changes and/or alterations in myoepithelial activity of cyclic adenosine-3,5-monophosphate (c-AMP), cyclic guanosine-3,5-monophosphate (c-GMP), and phosphodiesterase (PDE). It seems unlikely that PGs bring about significant posterior pituitary oxytocin release in rats.",
    "output": "The type of receptor blockade that eliminated the anti-oxytocin effects of PGE1 and E2 in lactating rats was alpha-receptor blockade. Under this blockade, the activity of oxytocin increased, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of PGE1 and E2 on oxytocin were alleviated. This was not the case for PGF2 alpha, as its oxytocin-antagonistic action was not affected by adrenergic blockers."

    "instruction": "What was the effect of PGE1 on isometric tension in isolated helical segments of lobar vein and artery?",
    "input": "The effects of prostaglandins E1 (PGE1) and F2alpha) on the pulmonary vascular bed were studied in the intact dog under conditions of controlled pulmonary blood flow. PGF2alpha increased lobar arterial and venous pressure when injected or infused into the lobar, artery. The pressor response was dose-related and doses as low as 0.03 and 0.1 mug, which established concentrations of 0.1 to 0.3 ng/ml in lobar arterial blood, increased pulmonary vascular resistance. PGF2alpha also increased airway resistance in the left lower lobe. However, the effects of this substance on the vascular bed were not related to its effects on bronchomotor tone since similar pressor responses were observed in normal and nonrespiring lobes, PGE1 decreased pressure in the lobar artery and vein when infused into the lobar artery and the effects of PGE1 and PGF2alpha on the pulmonary vascular bed were similar when the lung was perfused with dextran or with blood. PGF2alpha increased isometric tension in isolated helical segments of lobar vein 3 to 5 mm in diameter but was without effect on arterial segments of the same diameter. The increase in isometric tension in the venous segments with PGF2alpha was associated with a significant increase in intracellular levels of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) but no change in adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) levels. PGE1 decreased isometric tension in both arterial and venous segments and the decrease in tension was accompanied by a significant elevation in smooth muscle cAMP levels and a small but significant reduction in vein cGMP. Results of the present study indicate that PGF2alpha increases pulmonary resistance by constricting lobar veins and to a lesser extent vessels upstream in the precapillary bed whereas PGE1 dilates lobar veins and upstream vessels. These results suggest that PGE1-induced vasodilation may be mediated by an increase in cAMP levels while PGF2alpha-induced venoconstriction may be related to increased smooth muscle levels of cGMP.",
    "output": "In the context provided, it is stated that PGE1 decreased isometric tension in isolated helical segments of both arteries and veins, particularly lobar veins. This decrease in tension was associated with a significant elevation in smooth muscle cAMP levels and a small but significant reduction in vein cGMP levels. In contrast, PGF2alpha increased isometric tension in isolated helical segments of lobar veins but had no effect on arterial segments. This increase in tension was associated with a significant increase in intracellular levels of cGMP but no change in cAMP levels. These findings suggest that PGE1-induced vasodilation may be mediated by an increase in cAMP levels, while PGF2alpha-induced venoconstriction may be related to increased smooth muscle levels of cGMP."

    "instruction": "What substance was used to reverse the increased aggregatability of platelets in anesthetized rabbits with hyperglycemia?",
    "input": "All agree on altered platelet function in vitro (and increasingly in vivo) in diabetics of substantial duration and/or with clinical evidence of angiopathy. However, a platelet abnormality earlier in the disease remains uncertain. Three sets of data from Oxford will be reviewed: (1) Observations of Honour on platelet aggregation at sites of minimal injury within blood vessels of anesthetized rabbits, with greater sensitivity to superfused ADP when hyperglycemia has followed alloxan only days previously. This increased aggregatability (not hyperglycemia determined) is reversed by a few days of insulin treatment or by dipyrimadole (alone or with synergistic acetyl salicylic acid): (2) Beta-thromboglobulin is released from platelets and is increased in venesected blood from diabetics after a standardized procedure (no prostaglandin E1 in anticoagulant) with final radioimmunoassay. Results in diabetics after surgery, etc., will also be presented, and (3) in a prospective study of newly-diagnosed, mostly maturity-onset type diabetics, an increase in plasma fibrinogen (thrombin coagulation of plasma, controlled against normals) was observed during the first 3 yr, largely due to males treated with sulfonylureas; decreases in platelet count and in prothrombin concentration were also statistically significant.",
    "output": "The substance used to reverse the increased aggregatability of platelets in anesthetized rabbits with hyperglycemia, as observed in the study by Honour, was dipyrimadole. It was noted that dipyrimadole, alone or with synergistic acetyl salicylic acid, could reverse this increased aggregatability."

    "instruction": "What happens to prostacyclin activity in patients with uraemia and bleeding complications?",
    "input": "In several experimental and clinical conditions associated with thrombotic tendency, or complicated by thrombotic episodes, either prostacyclin (which inhibits platelet aggregation) or plasminogen activator (which promotes fibrinolysis), or both, appear to be decreased in the vessel wall. In other conditions, however, either activity may not change or even be increased. Possibly, vascular damage is followed by an early stimulation of both activities (a defence mechanism?) which may be subsequently reduced or exhausted. While the role of vascular plasminogen activator in haemorrhagic conditions is apparently unknown, prostacyclin activity appears to be markedly enhanced both in experimental animals and in patients with uraemia and bleeding complications. There is a suggestive evidence that uraemic plasma powerfully stimulates vascular prostacyclin generation.",
    "output": "In patients with uraemia and bleeding complications, prostacyclin activity is markedly enhanced. This enhancement is likely due to the powerful stimulation of vascular prostacyclin generation by uraemic plasma. This increase in prostacyclin activity is thought to be a defense mechanism against thrombotic tendency and complications, as prostacyclin inhibits platelet aggregation."

    "instruction": "What percentage of unselected male diabetics have plasma factors that enhance ADP-induced platelet aggregation?",
    "input": "Platelets from diabetic patients show both increased platelet adhesiveness and sensitivity to aggregating agents. Plasma levels of the platelet-active von Willebrand Factor and the closely related factor-VIII antigen are significantly elevated, while factor VIII procoagulant activity is not. This may reflect either intravascular coagulation or disproportionate production or degradation. Plasma factors that enhance ADP-induced platelet aggregation are found in 50% of unselected male diabetics. Activity is clearly demonstrated only when plasma is added immediately prior to adding subthreshold doses of ADP to platelet-rich plasma obtained from control subjects. Systematic investigations of the molecular nature of such factors and their interactions with platelets are in progress. In platelets obtained from diabetic subjects, we have previously found increased sensitivity to the aggregating effects of arachidonic acid, and increased synthesis of immunoreactive prostaglandin E-like material. More recent studies have shown that platelets obtained from diabetic subjects are less sensitive to the antiaggregatory effects of imidazole, a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor. These observations suggest that increased synthesis of the labile aggregating substance thromboxane A2 also occurs in platelets obtained from diabetics. Collectively, these platelet and plasma abnormalities may contribute to accelerated vascular disease of diabetes. Prospective studies using antiplatelet agents are presently underway or in the planning stages in diabetics to explore their potential beneficial effects.",

    "instruction": "What was the result of intravenous injections of low doses of adrenalin, antiplasmin, and tissue thromboplastin on platelets aggregation in experimental animals?",
    "input": "It was demonstrated in rat experiments that function inhibition of the anticoagulation system by means of intravenous injections of high doses of antiplasmin and aminasine resulted not only in certain changes in the blood coagulation parameters, but also in increased platelets aggregation. The appearance of increased quantities of free thrombin in the circulating blood may be one of the mechanisms favouring increased aggregation of platelets. The activation of the function of the anticoagulation system induced in experimental animals by intravenous injections of low doses of adrenalin, antiplasmin (12 U/200 g of body weight) and tissue thromboplastin results, along with hypocoagulation and enhanced enzymatic and non-enzymatic fibrinolysis, in a decreased platelets aggregation.",
    "output": "Intravenous injections of low doses of adrenalin, antiplasmin, and tissue thromboplastin in experimental animals resulted in decreased platelets aggregation. This is due to the activation of the anticoagulation system, which leads to hypocoagulation and enhanced enzymatic and non-enzymatic fibrinolysis."

These investigations were done on 12 patients during 22 treatments with hemofiltration. Blood samples were taken before hemofiltration, 10, 30 and 120 minutes after the beginning of the treatment and at the end of hemofiltration. In comparison to the original values we found a loss of platelets, a small decrease in the concentration of fibrinogen and a small increase in the fibrin monomer complex, plasminogen, antithrombin III, alpha1-antitrypsin and in alpha2-macroglobulin. The thrombin time, the partial thromboplastin time and Quick's test showed that the blood of these patients contained sufficient hepatin. Use of fibrin plates (Astrup) showed no signs of fibrinolytic activity. Compared to the results, which were obtained some years ago during hemodialysis, we found a smaller extent of alterations of blood coagulation factors and number of platelets.",

    "instruction": "What happened to the venous prostacyclin activity in both patients after they were treated with plasma?",
    "input": "Two patients with the hemolytic uremic syndrome were treated with plasma exchange an infusion: in both cases, the reduced platelet count reverted to normal values and the microangiopathic anemia ceased within a few days. Systemic blood pressure and requirement for antihypertensive drug therapy were also markedly reduced following treatment with plasma. Venousprostacyclin (antiplatelet aggregating) activity was undetectable in both patients before but was restored after treatment with plasma. The plasma samples collected before, but not those collected at various intervals after replacement therapy, had decreased capacity to stimulate prostacyclin activity in rat aortic rings. It is suggested that in patients with the hemolytic uremic syndrome or with other clinical conditions which can be included under this rubric (such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) a plasma factor is lacking which stimulates prostacyclin activity. Plasma would supply such a missing factor, thus representing a rational treatment for some of the life-threatening manifestations (thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, hypertension) of this severe syndrome.",
    "output": "The venous prostacyclin activity in both patients was undetectable before treatment with plasma, but it was restored after the treatment. This suggests that in patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome, or similar conditions like thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a plasma factor is lacking which stimulates prostacyclin activity. Treatment with plasma supplies this missing factor, helping to alleviate the life-threatening manifestations such as thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and hypertension associated with this severe syndrome."

    "instruction": "What temperature reduced considerable amounts of platelet antithrombin activity after brief exposure?",
    "input": "Antithrombin activity has been identified in intact washed human platelets. An apparent activity was demonstrated at platelet concentrations above 0.31 X 10(9)/ml, when platelet suspensions were incubated with 2.0 NIH units/ml of thrombin. Neither red cells nor white cells revealed antithrombin activity. No significant loss of the platelet antithrombin activity was observed after ten successive washings or after treatment of platelets with antibodies to antithrombin III or alpha2-macroglobulin. Almost the same amount of antithrombin activity as normal platelets was demonstrated in the platelets from an afibrinogenemic patient. Pre-treatment of platelets with trypsin, papain, and neuroaminidase reduced the activity significantly, whereas lipase was without effect. The platelet antithrombin reacted with thrombin in less than 3 seconds, and this rapid reaction of platelet antithrombin was different from that of plasma antithrombin III or fibrinogen. The thrombin-like clotting activity of ancrod was inhibited by fibrinogen but not platelets. Also, unlike plasma antithrombin III or fibrinogen, brief exposure to heat (56 degrees C or 60 degrees C) reduced considerable amounts of platelet antithrombin activity. These results suggest that platelets possess a specific antithrombin with different characteristics from other known antithrombins.",

    "input": "In a series of in vitro studies, both the soluble (plasmatic) coagulation system and the cellular (platelet-mediated) aspect of coagulation were shown to be extremely sensitive to relatively minor increases in hydrogen ion concentration. All studies became abnormal at pH 6.8. At pH 6.4, assays of the intrinsic and extrinsic coaglution systems, the polymerization of fibrinogen, and assay of the availability of platelet phospholipid (platelet factor 3) were twice prolonged over control values. Platelet aggregation was reduced by more than 50%. At pH 5.4 in vitro, platelet aggregation and plasma coagulation were both virtually abolished. Furthermore, previously formed platelet aggregates disaggregated at a slightly acid pH. Pepsin further enhanced platelet disaggregation. Because gastric acidity is normally two to four orders of magnitude greater than that which abolishes platelet aggregation and plasma clotting in vitro, and pepsin is present in abundance, we call attention to the probable antihemostatic effect of hydrocloric acid and pepsin in the upper gastrointestinal tract. This in vitro study may provide a rationale for meticulous regulation of intragastric pH in an effort to control upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.",

The effect on coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters was studied. The platelet count, Owren's P&P (prothrombin plus factors VII and X), plasminogen, factor XIII, and antithrombin III did not change during the treatment. All patients developed a proteolytic activity demonstrable on both unheated and heated fibrin plates. The fibrinogen decreased successively to very low levels, and parallel to this an increase in fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products was found. The factor VIII and factor V activities decreased immediately after each Lysofibrin infusion but normalized rapidly again. The factor VIII molecule, however, retained its reactivity to rabbit antiserum against factor VIII. Immediately after the plasmin infusion a decrease of both alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2-M) and the rapidly reacting alpha2-antiplasmin was observed. alpha2-M decreased successively and in several of the patients values were unmeasurable for a period of some days. A complex formation between pig plasmin and the alpha2-antiplasmin was demonstrated in crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The complexes were rapidly cleared from the circulation. No interaction between the pig plasmin and the inhibitor of the plasminogen activation, alpha1-antitrypsin or inter-alpha-inhibitor, was found.",

    "input": "Coagulation and fibrinolytic studies were made on 25 women who had a normal puerperium and breast fed their babies and on 32 otherwise healthy women who had lactation suppressed by diethylstilboestrol. In the untreated patients the fibrinogen, Factors VIII and IX, platelet count, and antifibrinolytic activity increased, and the levels of Factors  II, VII, and X and of plasminogen and plasminogen proactivator decreased. The incidence of cold activation of Factor VII decreased slowly from the 5th postpartum day onwards. The concentration of antithrombin III which was depressed in pregnancy, increased in the puerperium and was the only observed change that counteracted an increased coagulation potential. Oestrogen treatment produced further increases of Factors II, VII, and X, platelet count, and the cold activation of Factor VII while it decreased the concentration of antithrombin III. These changes favoured coagulation but were possibly to some degree counterbalanced by an increased concentration of plasminogen and decreased antifibrinolytic activity.",

The weak tumor initiator 1,2,3,4-dibenazanthracene (1,2,3,4-DBA), at dose level of 200 nmoles, increased AHH activity more than 10-fold over that of the acetone controls at 12 hr after treatment. Administration of the same quantity of the potent initiator 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) increased AHH activity approximately 4-fold over that of the control at 12 hr after treatment. Simultaneous treatment with 200 or 100 nmoles of DMBA and 1,2,3,4-DBA resulted in AHH activity that was 546 and 732% that of the controls, respectively, 12 hr after treatment: this was less AHH activity than was observed when 1,2,3,4-DBA was administered alone. Doses of 20 nmoles or more of 1,2,3,4-DBA, when given at about the same time as DMBA, effectively inhibited DMBA initiation of skin tumors in a two stage system of tumorigenesis. The results suggest that the weak initiator 1,2,3,4-DBA may program the epidermal AHH system to metabolize the strong carcinogen DMBA to noncarcinogenic intermediate(s).",

A dramatic increase in the number of acid phosphatase-rich macrophages was present in adenomas when compared to that in normal colonic mucosa. Fewer numbers of these cells were seen in well-differentiated adenocarcinomas, and they were barely detectable in highly invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas. It is postulated that these macrophages may play a role in preventing the invasion of adenomatous neoplasms into the submucosa. Application of histochemical techniques to study macrophage lysosomal enzymes may prove a useful diagnostic tool in differentiation of human colonic tumors for prognostic evaluation.",

The incidence of regressions was only to a limited extent associated with tumor size, tumor duration and total number of tumors. Repeated DMBA treatment, 5 microgram twice a week induced the same types of tumors in larger numbers: with a smaller incidence of regressions and only if they were transient in nature, i.e., lasting less than 3 weeks. These occurred in animals which showed a large number of persisting tumors simultaneously, but which rarely displayed multiple regressions.

No animals receiving DMN without partial hepatectomy developed liver carcinomas. Previous evidence had suggested that the incidence of tumours was highest when DMN was administered during the wave of DNA replication which follows partial hepatectomy. The present experiments made this suggestive evidence statistically significant. A single treatment with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) induced liver cell cancer when given to intact or to partially hepatectomised rats. No tumors developed when another alkylating carcinogen, methyl methanesulphonate (MMS), was administered after partial hepatectomy. The significance of these results in relation to the mechanism of initiation of carcinogenesis is discussed.",

Under the influence of a single dose of 150 microgram of hypothalamic gonadotrophin liberation factor (LHRH), there was a preferential increase in FSH whilst levels of LH were little influenced. The continuous infusion of LHRH was associated with the same phenomenon. Only prolonged administration (for approximately 12 months) of chorionic gonadotrophins, resultes in a significant rise in plasma testosterone levels (low in all cases in the absence of stimulation). The level of urinary 3alpha-androstanediol represents a good parameter of androgenicity. Urinary 3beta-androstanediol is a metabolite of androgens formed in the liver. In hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, and in particular in de Morsier's syndrome, the essential element would seem to be the absence of solicitation of the pituitary gonadotrophic cells by virtue of inadequate secretion of LHRH. The results of stimulation with chorionic gonadotrophins reflects the existence of inadequate maturation of testicular receptors to these hormones.",

Basal plasma E2, E1, T, DHT, DHA and DHAS concentrations significantly correlated with the releasable pool of LH evoked by Gn-RH from the pituitary gonadotropes. We conclude: 1) The ovary is not highly and rapidly responsive to transient elevations of endogenous gonadotropin, and 2) Adrenal androgens may to some extent modulate the maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal system, at least as reflected by the pituitary response to exogenous Gn-RH.",

Only three patients had abnormally high basal levels of LH and/or elevated LH responses to LH-RH. The basal plasma testosterone levels were found to be normal in all 112 bosy. The fact that plasma FSH levels were elevated more often than LH levels suggests that the tubular elements are damaged more frequently than are the Leydig cells. The surprisingly high incidence of an abnormal response of plasma FSH to LH-RH in boys with mobile testes calls for an increased awareness of the importance of regular examination of these patients until full puberty has been achieved. It is concluded that determination of basal plasma FSH levels and the response to LH-RH stimulation is a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating testicular function in prepubertal boys with suspected pathology of the testes.",

Correlation between testosterone responses and FSH levels (r - 0.718, P less than 0.002) in the pre-pubertal hypopituitary patients was highly significant. No such correlation was observed between testosterone response and LH.

NAD+, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and inorganic phosphate all afford protection from inhibition, and inhibition is slowly reversed in the presence of pyrophosphate at pH 8.5. 3. Kinetic and spectral studies have shown that the specific inhibition is associated with the succinylation of the aliphatic hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residue. 4. The residue specifically succinylated has been identified as one of the two threonine residues, most probably Thr-150, adjacent to the activ-site cysteine residue in the primary structure. Its unusual reactivity is discussed in relation to the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme. 5. A second residue, a lysine homologous with Lys-212 in the pig muscle enzyme, can be succinylated in both holoenzyme and apoenzyme with no detectable effect upon the enzymic activity.",

    "input": "Yeast hexokinase is rapidly inactivated by 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate and nitrotyrosyl ethyl ester. Sugar substrates afford a partial protection, which is increased by the addition of ADP.

Exhaustive proteolytic digestion of the modified protein and isolation of the nitrotyrosyl peptide by affinity chromatography, followed by electrophoresis, lead to the identification of the modified residue as a glutamyl residue. This modification of hexokinase occurs without gross conformational changes. The enzyme still binds its substrates, though binding of the nucleotides is perturbed. While the substrates afford a partial protection, they increase the incorporation of nitrotyrosine ethyl ester into the enzyme. This may be attributed to local conformational changes which their binding induces. It is concluded that a glutamyl residue is essential for yeast hexokinase activity and its catalytic function is discussed.",

    "input": "Ribonuclease T2 was isolated from an Aspergillus oryzae extract. In order to define the substrate specificity, the hydrolysis of a series of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotides was measured semiquantitatively. Modifications in all positions of the bases are tolerated, as long as the base stays in the anti conformation or has a chance to return to it; bulky substituents at N-3 of the pyrimidine base lower the rate. So far the conclusion seems justified that the enzyme does not react with the substrates by specific bonds to the base, but rather by hydrophobic binding. The conformation specificity and the pH dependence of the activity support this hypothesis. The pH optima with substrates which may be positively or negatively charged are shifted to pH values at which the substrates are uncharged. This strongly indicates a hydrophobic type of interaction between base and enzyme. From the pH dependence of the kinetic parameters Km and k+2, an enzyme group with a pK of 7 (probably histidine) can be postulated. This group should interact in the protonated form with the phosphate anion. Another B.HB-system (probably two carboxylate groups) seems to be involved in the catalysis step, performing the base catalysis at the 2'-OH group and the proton catalysis at the phosphate oxygen simultaneously.",

    "input": "Synthesis of a series of active N-hydroxysuccinimide esters of aliphatic and aromatic amino acids has yielded a new class of reagents for the covalent modification of proteolytic enzymes such as thermolysin. The activities of aliphatic acyl amino acid thermolysins are from 1.7 to 3.6 times greater than that of the native enzyme when hydrolyzing durylacryloyl-Gly-Leu-NH2, the substrate employed most widely. By comparison, the aromatic acylamino acid derivatives are \"superactive,\" their activities being as much as 70-fold greater. Apparently, the aromatic character of the amino acid introduced is a critical variable in the determination of the functional response. The increased activity is completely restored to that of the native enzyme by deacylation with nucleophiles, such as hydroxylamine, and the rate of restoration of native activity is a function of the particular acyl group incorporated. Preliminary evidence regarding the chemical properties of the modified enzyme suggests that tyrosine, rather than lysine, histidine, or arginine, may be the residue modified. The functional consequences of successive modification with different reagents, moreover, indicate that each of them reacts with the same protein residue. The competitive inhibitors beta-phenyl-propionyl-Phe and Zn-2+ do not prevent modification with these active esters. Hence, the site(s) of their inhibitory action differ(s) from that at which modification occurs. The structure of the substrate is also a significant variable which determines the rate at which each acyl amino acid thermolysin hydrolyzes peptides. Depending on the particular substrate, the activity of aromatic derivatives can be as much as 400-fold greater than that of the native enzyme, and the resultant activity patterns can be ordered in a series characteristic for each enzyme derivative.",

Investigations with structural analogues of phenylalanine indicated an absolute requirement for the aromatic ring and both the alpha-carboxyl and alpha-amino groups of phenylalanine for inhibition of 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthetase(phe) activity. Replacement of the alpha-H atom with a methyl group does not decrease the inhibition greatly. Varying degrees of inhibition were observed with o, m and p mono-substituted fluoro, chloro and hydroxy phenylalanines. D-Phenylalanine and several metabolites of the aromatic biosynthetic pathways do not inhibit enzymic activity. 2. Circular dichroism studies indicated that the native enzyme possesses approximately 26% alpha-helix. Both circular dichroic and ultraviolet difference spectra indicated that the addition of phenylalanine to the synthetase induces a conformational change involving a small alteration of the secondary structure and large alterations in th interactions of some of the aromatic residues of the enzyme.

    "input": "The effects of various agents that could be expected to perturb enzyme structure in a non-specific and reversible manner (alcohols, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, dinitrobenzene, urea and guanidine - HCl) have been determined on reaction of acetylcholinesterase (acetylcholine hydrolase, EC 3.1.1.7) with a substrate, p-nitrophenyl acetate, and two irreversible inhibitors, diisopropylphosphorofluoridate and methanesulfonyl fluoride. In all three of these reactions an acyl group (acetyl, phosphoryl or sulfonyl respectively) bonds covalently with the active center of the enzyme. As expected, the reactions of p-nitrophenyl acetate and diisopropylphosphorofluoridate were severely retarded by most of these agents. By contrast, reaction of methanesulfonyl fluoride was usually depressed to a far smaller degree, and in two cases was faster. These findings are of interest in connection with: (1) differing requirements for the integrity of tha active center in catalysis with various substrate analogs, and (2) the mechanism by which cationic substrate analogs accelerate reaction of the enzyme with methanesulfonyl fluoride.",
    "output": "In the reactions described, an acyl group forms a covalent bond with the active center of the enzyme. This bonding occurs through an acyl-enzyme intermediate, a common intermediate in enzyme-catalyzed reactions involving acyl groups. This bond is typically formed through an acyl transfer reaction, where the acyl group transfers from the substrate to the enzyme's active site. In the case of acetylcholinesterase, this can occur with acetyl, phosphoryl, or sulfonyl groups, as shown in the context provided."

The effective deacylation rate constants of some phenyl acetates obtained by titration of the acetyl-enzyme decreased at low substrate concentrations and showed anomalous pH dependences and solvent isotope effects. The transient kinetics of deacylation of the acetyl-enzyme were biphasic. A spectrum and a breakdown rate similar to those of acetylimidazole were observed when the acetyl-enzyme was denaturated with sodium dodecyl sulfate. These results indicate the participation of histidine-acylated enzyme, which woud account for the anomalous phenomena previously found in this system, including a large value of Hammett's rho. The relation between the substrate activation and the two intermediates is discussed.",

    "input": "Enzyme activity can be measured in single cells or in cell suspensions by either static or flow microfluorometry when a fluorogenic substrate is used. We have used amino acid derivatives of arylamines as fluorogenic substrates for tagging cellular proteinases. The liberated aromatic amine, which can diffuse from the cell, is trapped as a fluorescent insoluble Schiff-base product with 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde, with the peak of fluorescence emission shifted from lambdaem 425 nm to lambdaem 530 and 595 nm. Although the reaction is faster at pH 4 than at higher pH's, the equilibrium during the assay of certain peptidase activities is such that the liberated aromatic amine is trapped in the cell at pH values as high as 7.5. 5-Nitrosalicylaldehyde causes almost no inhibition of substrate hydrolysis at 1 mmol/liter, a concentration exceeding that required for complete trapping of reaction product. The kinetics of enzymatic reactions with four synthetic substrates are demonstrated in intact Balb 3T3 cells and sonicated preparations in the presence of 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde. Hydrolytic rates for the substrate, CBZ-ala-arg-arg-4-methoxy-beta-naphthylamine, are given for single 3T3 cells by microfluorophotometry and for suspensions of 3T3 cells by flow cytometry. The clinical value of the method is demonstrated for differentiating mixed populations of leukocytes.",
    "output": "5-Nitrosalicylaldehyde at a concentration of 1 mmol/liter does not cause significant inhibition of substrate hydrolysis. Instead, it acts as a trap for the liberated aromatic amine, which is a product of the enzymatic reaction. The shift in the fluorescence emission from lambdaem 425 nm to lambdaem 530 and 595 nm indicates the formation of a Schiff-base product with the trapped aromatic amine. This method is valuable for measuring enzyme activity in single cells or cell suspensions, particularly for differentiating mixed populations of leukocytes."

The functional residual capacity was then increased by positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), so that ventilation took place at a lung volume where no airway closure was present, and the effect on arterial oxygenation was again investigated. A significant increase in alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient occurred in the group of seven patients in whom airway closure within a tidal breath could be demonstrated during anaesthesia, but there was no significant change in the four patients in whom airway closure could not be demonstrated. There was no improvement in arterial oxygenation on increasing functional residual capacity (FRC) in either group. It may well be that this failure to improve oxygenation was due to a deleterious effect of PEEP on the circulation, even though the PEEP was the minimum required to abolish airway closure.",

The main factors involved in the indication of assisted ventilation are the number of acute failures, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, cor pulmonale. In our department, 53 patients were kept under prolonged supervision before a decision was made to use assisted ventilation or not. This attitude seems absolutely necessary.

The use of P.E.E.P. resulted in a significant reduction in the increase in alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (AaDO21) which occurred in the group of patients who were converted from controlled ventilation to spontaneous ventilation without P.E.E.P. Patients who weaned without P.E.E.P. had a mean increase in AaDO21 of 102+/-35 mm Hg S.E. while those who weaned with P.E.E.P. had a mean increase of only 10+/-22 mm Hg (P less than 0-03). The use of P.E.E.P. was also associated with a significant improvement in the vital capacity and the maximum inspiratory force. Patients who weaned with P.E.E.P. had an increase in vital capacity of 258+/-108 ml (P less than 0-05) and an increase in inspiratory force of -15+/-5 cm H2O (P less than 0-01), while patients who weaned without P.E.E.P. did not have significant changes in these measurements. The use of P.E.E.P. during weaning may be helpful in patients who fail to wean because of the development of hypoxaemia due to rapid alveolar collapse, since P.E.E.P. appears to minimise the increase in intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt which normally occurs during weaning from controlled ventilation.",

    "input": "Positive and expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been used for several years in the treatment of acute respiratory failure. Dramatic improvement in the chest radiograph may occur with institution of PEEP; the degree of change parallels the levels of positive and expiratory pressure used. Conversely, weaning from mechanical ventilation may be associated with deterioration in the radiographic picture despite improvement in arterial blood gases and lung compliance. Serial chest films of representative patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome are reviewed and changes in the radiographic pattern are correlated with the amount of PEEP. The efficacy of PEEP in reducing intrapulmonary shunting and improving arterial oxygenation is related to increasing functional residual capacity, with improvement of diffuse atelectasis and associated shift of pulmonary water from the alveoli to the interstitial space and pulmonary capillaries. The changing radiologic manifestations reflect these physiologic phenomena. Pulmonary barotrauma is a frequent complication of PEEP therapy. Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and interstitial emphysema may lead to rapid deterioration of a patient maintained on mechanical ventilation with an already compromised respiratory status.",
    "output": "Potential complications of PEEP therapy that may lead to rapid deterioration of a patient's respiratory status include pulmonary barotrauma such as pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and interstitial emphysema.

These responses were compared to those of a control group of 17 patients with similar ventilatory abnormality but without hypoxemia. Hypoxemic patients demonstrated significantly less response to hypoxia than did control subjects in terms of both ventilation and P0.1 The decreased hypoxic response might be analogous to that reported in high altitude dwellers and patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. Ventilatory responses to CO2 were depressed in hypoxemic patients, but P0.1 responses were not significantly decreased. While breathing at rest with arterial O2 saturation of 95 per cent, hypoxemic patients demonstrated the same minute ventilation as control subjects, but tidal volume was smaller, inspiratory duration was shorter, and breathing frequency was slightly higher. This breathing pattern appeared to be independent of whether or not these patients retained CO2.",

Our own results illustrate the effect of therapy of the underlying lung disease and of the concomitant respiratory insufficiency on the pulmonary arterial hypertension. The relationship between pulmonary artery pressure (PAp), arterial oxygen tension, forced expiratory volume of 1 second (FEV1%VC) and slow inspired viral capacity (VC) is analysed. In obstructive respiratory disorders the PAp rises when FEV1 falls below 40% of VC, in restrictive disorders when VC falls below 70% of predicted rate. 27 patients with chronic obstructive lung disease were treated with bronchodilator aerosols by intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) during 2 years after a control period of 2 years: VC and FEV1 improved, the increase of total lung capacity and the deterioration of arterial blood gases came to a halt. The elevated PAp was always significantly reduced by oxygen therapy or IPPB or the combination of both. Finally, the rationale for avoiding physical stress in established cor pulmonale is illustrated: in healthy men PAp increases by less than 20% when cardiac output is doubled. In patients with cor pulmonale PAp rises to three times the initial value under the same conditions.",

H2O CPAP or PEEP, and in nine instances, with each patient on the ventilator but without PEEP (O PEEP). During CPAP, when compared to PEEP at the same level of end-expiratory pressure, mean PaO2 increased significantly (p less than 0.05) and mean physiological shunt decreased (p less than 0.05). In nine of 11 instances, cardiac output was higher on CPAP than on a corresponding level of PEEP. Thus CPAP was more effective than the same amount of PEEP in improving arterial oxygenation by the lung without adversely affecting cardiac output.",

This statistically significant modification was regarded as an expression of a different distribution of blood in lung vessels dued to an increasing of this vascular compliance and to a decrease of alveolar inflation.

The two methods provided nearly identical quantitation of these interactions with cytochrome P-450. Two distinct high spin forms of cytochrome P-450 were revealed by EPR spectra. The predominant high spin species (g = 8.2) was decreased by addition of 20alpha-hydroxycholesterol and elevated pH but was increased by addition of cholesterol. The minor high spin species (g = 8.1) was incrreased by addition of deoxycorticosterone but decreased by low concentrations of metyrapone. The two forms were evidently not in equilibrium and have been assigned to distinct forms of cytochrome P-450 involved in, respectively, cholesterol side chain cleavage (P-450scc) and steroid 11beta hydroxylation (P-450(11)beta). The high spin states are derived from complexes of these P-450 cytochromes with endogenous substrates, which are, respectively, cholesterol and deoxycorticoids. A high to low spin transition was observed when these complexes were turned over by initiating hydroxylation with malate. The contributions of cytochromes P-450(11)beta and P-450scc to the low spin spectrum were also resolved by similar means. At least 20% of P-450scc is in the low spin state while about 90% of P-450(11)beta is low spin in isolated beef adrenal mitochondria. Low spin complexes of cytochrome P-450scc with 20alpha-hydroxycholesterol and 3beta-hydroxypregn-5-ene-20-one (pregnenolone) gave distinct EPR spectra. Aminoglutethimide interacted with the total cytochrome P-450 content of the bovine adrenal mitochondria forming low spin complexes. Both optical and EPR data indicated binding to two forms of cytochrome P-450. These results suggest a detailed correlation between the spin state and absorbance changes seen at room temperature, illustrate that EPR allows the distinction of two principal forms of P-450, and suggest that there is no appreciable change in the spin state of either cytochrome between 14 K and 300 K.",

Coupling constants and chemical shifts are as expected from spectra of the model glycosides, methyl beta-D-glucopyranosiduronate, methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranoside and methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-galactopyranoside, when allowance is made for systematic influences on chemical shifts of interglycosidic linkages and sulphate substitution. As reported elsewhere, addition of alkali causes the hyaluronate spectrum to sharpen considerably. This is taken to indicate that segmental motion is enhanced by disruption of some system of inter-residue bonding on ionisation of hydroxy groups. Concomitant changes in chemical shifts are seen mainly for H-2 of the glucuronate residue, and the CH3 and H-2 of the acetamidodeoxyglucose residue. Similar effects are not seen for chondroitin sulphates, either in line widths or chemical shifts. Comparison of the spectra of hyaluronate, chondroitin sulphates, and the model glycosides, indicates that proton chemical shifts are sensitive to the conformation differences between the polysaccharides in alkaline solution, but do not detect the differences in neutral solution that are known from NMR relaxation to be present. The altered configuration and/or substitution pattern of the acetamidodeoxyhexose residue in hyaluronate compared with chondroitin sulphates appears to have a critical influence on overall conformation in both alkaline and neutral solution.",

In respiratory nitrate reductase I of Klebsiella aerogenes, 0.24 atom of molybdenum, eight iron-sulfur groups and four tightly bound, non-heme iron atoms per molecule of enzyme (Mr 260 000) are found. 2. EPR spectra at 83 degrees K of oxidized and reduced nitrate reductase I show complex lines at g = 2.02 and g = 1.98, which are more intense in the reduced than in the oxidized enzyme. The resonances, the shape and intensity of which are rather temperature insensitive, are attributed to two species of paramagnetic molybdenum. In dithionite-reduced enzyme all these lines are saturated at the same microwave power of 15 mW. This is not the case in oxidized enzyme, where the resonance at g = 2.02 is hard to saturate. Addition of nitrate to dithionite-reduced reductase I decreases the intensity of the EPR lines to about that of oxidized enzyme. The participation of molybdenum in the electron transfer process has been discussed. 3. At 18 degrees K the oxidized enzyme exhibits an axial-symmetrical signal with g parallel = 2.10 and g = 2.03, and a signal with unknown symmetry at g = 2.015. Upon reduction by dithionite, a ferredoxin type of signal is observed with g values at 2.05, 1.95 and 1.88, while the g = 2.015 signal disappears. Reoxidation by nitrate causes a concomitant disappearance of the ferredoxin type of signal and reappearance of the g = 2.015 signal; hence iron-sulfur centres participate in the transfer of electrons to nitrate. 4. Nitrate reductase II, containing only two (Mr 117 000 and 57 000) of the three subunits found in nitrate reductase I and lacking the tightly bound iron, does not exhibit the axial-symmetrical signal (g = 2.10 and 2.03).

    "input": "The electron-spin relaxation of iron-sulphur centres in a range of simple proteins (ferredoxin, high-potential iron-sulphur protein and rubredoxin) was investigated by means of the temperature dependence and microwave power saturation of the EPR signal. The proteins containing [2Fe-2S] centres all showed temperature optima higher than those for [4Fe-4S] centres, but the difference between the slowest-relaxing [4Fe-4S] protein (Chromatium high-potential iron-sulphur protein) and the fastest-relaxing [2Fe-2S] protein (Halobacterium halobium ferredoxin) was small. A greater distinction was seen in the power saturation behaviour at low temperature (10--20 K). The behaviour of the signal intensity as a function of microwave power was analyzed in terms of the power for half saturation P 1/2 and the degree of homogeneous/inhomogeneous broadening. The effect of distorting the protein structure by salts, organic solvents and urea was to decrease the electron-spin relaxation rate as shown by a decreased value of P 1/2. The addition of Ni2+ as a paramagnetic perturbing agent caused an increase in the electron-spin relaxation rate of all the proteins, with the exception of adrenal ferredoxin, as shown by an increased P 1/2 and, in a few cases, broadening of the linewidth. Ferricyanide, a commonly used oxidizing agent, has similar effects. These results are discussed in relation to the use of paramagnetic probes to determine whether iron-sulphur centres are near to a membrane surface. Spin-spin interactions between two paramagnetic centres in a protein molecule such as a 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxin, lead to more rapid electron-spin relaxation. This method was used to detect a spin-spin interaction between molybdenum V and centre Fe-SI in xanthine oxidase.",

    "input": "Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and optical absorbance difference spectra and kinetics upon illumination by saturating flashes and continuous light of spinach chloroplasts frozen under various conditions were measured between 10 and 180 K. 1. At 100 K illumination with continuous light caused an EPR signal which decayed during the light in about 30 ms. This change is probably due to the reduction of P+-680, the oxidized primary electron donor of Photosystem II, by a secondary electron donor, cytochrome b-559. Flash illumination yielded the previously observed rapid (2 ms) transient. This transient has been ascribed to a back-reaction of the two primary reagents of Photosystem II (Malkin, R. and Bearden, A.J. (1975) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 396, 250-259; Visser, J.W.M. (1975) Thesis, Leiden). 2. Between 10 and 40 K, illumination with continuous light showed a transient which decayed in about 500 ms. The extent decreased with increasing temperature. However, the half time appeared to be temperature independent. This signal was also attributed to P+-680. 3. At 180 K it appeared to be impossible to observe the 2 and 30 ms components in dark frozen chloroplasts. However, they could be observed again if two short saturating flashes were given shortly before freezing. These changes seem to be dependent on the S-state of the reaction center. 4. After oxidizing the sample with ferricyanide (Eh = 540 mV), the light induced absorbance difference spectrum showed a bleaching near 676 nm. This change is ascribed to the irreversible oxidation of a dimeric chlorophyll molecule which acts as electron donor to P+-680 under these conditions. 5. Titration curves of the irreversible light-induced absorbance change at 676 nm and the irreversible light-induced EPR change near g = 2.00 provide strong evidence that these two changes reflect the same compound. Finally, a model is given to explain the observed reactions of Photosystem II at 10-180 K. The model involves three different ultimate and one intermediate electron donor to P+-680 at these temperatures.",
    "output": "The temperature range in which the EPR and optical absorbance difference spectra and kinetics of spinach chloroplasts were measured is between 10 and 180 K. The measurements were conducted under various conditions, including illumination with continuous light and saturating flashes. The observed changes in EPR signals and absorbance differences were attributed to the reduction and oxidation of various electron donors, such as P+-680 and a dimeric chlorophyll molecule, in Photosystem II."

    "input": "The interactions of 5 carcinogenic and 1 non-carcinogenic nitrosamines with hepatic microsomal cytochrome (cyt.) P-450 were investigated, using both optical difference and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic methods. Liver microsomes from phenobarbital (PB)-pretreated mice and 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC)-pretreated rats were used, in order to have an increased specific content of cyt. P-450 and cyt. P-448 respectively. The optical and EPR spectral data obtained in the oxidised state suggest that nitrosamines are able to bind both as substrates and as ligands to the hemoprotein cyt. P-450, depending on the concentration of nitrosamine, its chemical identity and the cytochrome species present. After reduction with dithionite or NADPH in the optical difference spectrum a Soret band developed between 444 and 453 nm to an extent, which is dependent on the particular nitrosamine present. This initial nitrosamine-induced spectrum might represent a ferrous nitric oxide (NO)-cyt. P-450 complex. It appears unstable and is converted kinetically into a spectrum lacking a Soret band, but with a predominant absorbance minimum at about 425 nm. A visible band is located at 585 nm. In the EPR spectrum a sharp 3-line signal around g = 2.01 appears concomitantly. Both spectral parameters are typical of a NO-cyt. P-420 complex. These results, in conjunction with metabolic studies, indicate that nitrosamines are denitrosated by a reductive process in which cyt. P-450 appears to be involved. The resulting NO-cyt. P-450 complex denatures to a NO-cyt. P-420 complex when the dioxygen level is not sufficiently high to complete successfully.",

    "input": "The phosphocarrier protein HPr has been investigated by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at 270 MHz in order to evaluate structural properties of the whole molecule and its active site. The titration behaviour of the three tyrosines of the HPr protein was analysed by monitoring the chemical shifts of the aromatic proton resonances of these residues as a function of pH. It was found that the HPr protein contains a lot of slowly exchanging NH backbone protons which suggested a relatively rigid secondary structure of the protein molecule itself although it contains no disulfide bridges. The HPr protein shows a sharp reversible denaturation behaviour at alkaline pH values. Between pH 10.8 and 11.1 two C-2 proton resonance peaks for the single histidine residue could be observed together with abrupt changes in the aromatic and aliphatic absorption region of the HPr protein which are due to chemical exchange processes. The NMR spectrum of the HPr protein is only changed a little upon raising the temperature from 14 degrees C to 70 degrees C. At 76 degrees C all resonances in the spectrum broaden and almost disappear. This process is irreversible.",

    "instruction": "What happens to the free/bound ratio of NAD(P)H in HPM-73 cells when they are treated with 10(-6) oligomycin?",
    "input": "Coenzyme fluorescence spectra of single living cells are due to free pyridine nucleotides (folded configuration), bound pyridine nucleotides (unfolded configuration) and a third component, possibly a mixture or flavins. Such spectra can be used to recognize possible differences in coenzyme composition between cell lines or changes of metabolic pathways due to chemicals acting at levels below or above cytotoxicity, by high resolution spectrofluorometry. A study of spectra recorded from cultured Ehrlich ascites (EL2), and Harding Passey melanoma cells (HPM-67 and HPM-73 line) grown under comparable conditions, shows that free NAD(P)H predominates in HPM-67 and EL2, while this coenzyme is bound in HPM-73. The free/bound ratio may be profoundly modifed by chemicals, e.g. in the HPM-73 increase of free and decrease of bound NAD(P)H occurred upon treatment with 10(-6) oligomycin. When atebrine at levels (10(-6) M) below cytotoxicity was added, there was a decrease of the free NAD(P)H spectrum possibly through energy transfer from NAD(P)H to atebrine. Consideration of long range energy transfer i.e., excitation of atebrine by fluorescence of NAD(P)H vs. short range transfer of excitation energy from free NAD(P)H to atebrine, favors the latter mechanism. A transient (reversible) increase in atebrine fluorescence is seen following intracellular microinjection of substrate (e.g. glucose-6-P) leading to an increase in free NAD(P)H. At cytotoxic levels of atebrine (e.g 2 x 10(-5) M) an irreversible increase of atebrine fluorescence is seen. The microspectrofluorometric technique appears therefore well suited to study physiological processes at the level of intracellular coenzymes, as well as possible processes of intermolecular energy transfer in the microenvironment.",
    "output": "When HPM-73 cells are treated with 10(-6) oligomycin, there is a profound modification in the free/bound ratio of NAD(P)H. Specifically, there is an increase in the free NAD(P)H and a decrease in the bound NAD(P)H. This change is likely due to the action of oligomycin on the cells' metabolic pathways."

    "input": "Proton magnetic resonance spectra of staphylococcal protease, a serine protease from Staphylococcus aureus, strain V8, are presented. Initial proton spectra were obtained at 220 MHz, and more detailed studies of the aromatic region were carried out by correlation spectroscopy at 250 MHz. The overall spectrum bears a close resemblance to one calculated from the sum of spectra of the component amino acids. Chemical shifts of the three tyrosine, four phenylalanine, and three histidine residues appear to be equivalent at pH 3.7 and 8.5 indicating that they are all in normal chemical environments in the enzyme. The staphylococcal protease contains a large number of slowly exchanging protons. In fact, interpretable spectra of the aromatic region were obtained only after extensive exchange of N-H groups with deuterium from the D2O solvent. Proton magnetic resonance titration studies of the three histidine residues indicate that these have normal chemical shifts and pK' values. When the data are fitted to single noninteracting titration curves, the histidine pK' values are 7.19 plus or minus 0.02, 6.85 plus or minus 0.03, and 6.69 plus or minus 0.02. The titration curves of two of the histidine residues indicate negative cooperativity. A possible explanation for this is a direct electrostatic interaction between the two histidines. The titration data for these histidines give a significantly better fit to such a mutual interaction model than to noninteracting titration curves. The component microscopic dissociation constants have been calculated. Mutual interaction leads to pK' displacements of 0.31 unit; which indicates a distance of approximately 7 angstrom between the two interacting histidine rings according to the model of Tanford and Roxby. The proton resonances of the two interacting histidines are doubled in the pH region 6.7-7.0 suggesting the presence of two forms of the enzyme having lifetimes in excess of 30 msec.",

All the chromosomal segments stained with C-technique are also stainable with G-technique, while only some G-positive segments are capable to be C-bands.

Similar bodies were subsequently found in the metaphases of several animal groups. The size, structure, spatial relationships to the nucleus, behavior throughout the cell cycle, and apparent universal presence of these bodies suggest that they are either centrioles or associated centriolar structures. These centriole-bodies can be seen throughout the cell cycle, even in hypotonically spread C-metaphase chromosome plates. The silver stain procedure allows enough resolution to distinguish parent and daughter centriole-bodies at interphase, thus permitting visualization of the replication, maturation and separation stages of these bodies with the light microscope.",

The stemline cells show a mode at 74-76. A metacentric chromosome is present in almost all the cells. Some cells show a long telocentric chromosome with a possible secondary constriction. C-bands are restricted at the telomeric regions of the chromosomes excepting in the metacentric one. From the banding pattern it seems that the nucleolar organizers are located at the telomeric region. No band is associated with the second constriction of the long telocentric chromosome. It is suggested that the long metacentric chromosome has arisen out of a Robertsonian translocation involving end to end centromeric fusion of two non-homologue chromosomes.",
    "output": "The long metacentric chromosome in the Ehrlich mouse ascites tumour cell line is suggested to have originated from a Robertsonian translocation, which involves an end-to-end centromeric fusion of two non-homologous chromosomes. This type of translocation is known for reducing the chromosome number and is a common mechanism in aneuploidy development. The absence of a band associated with the second constriction of the long telocentric chromosome, along with the nucleolar organizers being located at the telomeric region, supports this hypothesis."

The data from cells subjected to both banding techniques reveals that 30 per cent of the sites of chromosome breakage are situated at he interfaces between dark- and - light-stained bands. The results of all the analyses show that approximately 30 per cent of all breaks were located in either the telomere (19-5 per cent) or centromere (11-3 per cent) regions. Chromosomes rich in R-band material were not preferentially damaged, but chromosomes 12, 15, and particularly 17, were involved in aberrations more frequently than would be expected on the basis of their length. No breaks were found on the Y chromosome in the 114 male cells analysed, but the X did not appear to be spared from damage either in the male cells analysed, but the X did not appear to be spared from damage either in the male cell or the 136 female cells analysed.

Metaphase chromosomes from lymphocytes which had incorporated 5-bromodeoxyuridine for two replication cycles were treated with the dye 33258 Hoechst and photodegraded so that the sister chromatids exhibited differential Giemsa staining. A computer-controlled television-microscope system was used to acquire digitized metaphase spread images by direct scanning of microscope slides. Individual objects in the images were identified by a thresholding procedure. The probability that each object was a single, separate chromosome was estimated from size and shape measurements. An analysis of the spatial relationships of the dark-chromatid regions of each object yielded a set of possible exchange locations and estimated probabilities that such locations corresponded to sister chromatid exchanges. A normalized estimate of the sister chromatid exchange frequency was obtained by summing the joint probabilities that a location contained an exchange within a single, separate chromosome over the set of chromosomes from one or more cells and dividing by the expected value of the total chromosome area analyzed. Comparison with manual scoring of exchanges showed satisfactory agreement up to levels of approximately 30 sister chromatid exchanges/cell, or slightly more than twice control levels. The processing time for this automated sister chromatid exchange detection system was comparable to that of manual scoring.",

    "input": "Human chromosomes were labeled with base-specific radioactive DNA precursors and examined autoradiographically to measure their DNA content and base ratio (percentage A-T base pairs). The requirement that incorporation of labeled bases be uniform during DNA synthesis was met by the use of inhibitors of de novo synthesis of DNA precursors. The genome was subdivided into 75 segments based on quinacrine banding, and the base ratio of each was calculated by a method that corrects for bias due to the scatter of grains about their source. Estimates of base ratio are shown to be sufficiently precise to detect variability among chromosomes and among segments within a chromosome. Analysis of these data and of measurements of the quinacrine fluorescence intensity of segments leads to the following conclusions. Base ratio is positively correlated with brightness, as predicted from independent in vitro studies. Larger chromosomes tend to have higher base ratios and to be brighter than smaller ones. The best prediction of the brightness of a segment must take into account not only its base ratio but also its DNA content. To explain these results, we suggest an evolutionary model in which chromosomes containing repeated sequences of A-T-rich DNA tend to grow by means of unequal sister chromatid and meiotic exchanges.",

Production of IS was accompanied by decrease of the frequency of SCE, the total frequency of SCE+IS remained, however, the same as in control. An antagonism between SCE and IS was established: the frequency of SCE decreased in the cells with multiple IS, and chromosomes with both SCE and IS were only rarely observed. Thus, IS is neither an artifact nor a physiologic event but a phenomenon induced by radiation. The reliable existence of IS is considered as an evidence for binemic structure of chromatid.

    "input": "The subtle morphology and functional properties of cells are the best parameters to use for their definition. This is also true for the corresponding tumours, especially malignant lymphomata. In studies of 106 cases of malignant lymphoma we therefore applied as morphological methods haematological staining (Giemsa in sections and imprints) and electron microscopic analysis. As functional criteria we used the nonspecific esterase reaction to define tumours of histiocytes and an estimation of the immunoglobulin content of tissue extracts and single cells to define tumours of B lymphocytes and their derivatives. By combining all of these methods it was possible to propose a new classification. Whereas not one histiocytic malignant lymphoma (\"reticulosarcoma\") was found in the series, at least most of the malignant lymphomata investigated seemed to be derived from the B lymphocyte system. The following types are distinguished: (1) Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; (2) diffuse germinocytoma (malignant lymphoma, lymphocytic, intermediate); (3) germinoblastoma (follicular, follicular and diffuse, diffuse; sclerotic, nonsclerotic) which can show a transition into germinoblastic sarcoma; (4) immunoblastic sarcoma of the B cell type (previously called reticulo-sarcoma); (5) lymphoplasmocytoid immunocytoma, which may be associated with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia and can show a mixed cellularity; (6) lymphoblastic (paraleukoblastic) sarcoma and leukaemia, which are, at least in most cases, probably neoplasias of germinoblasts. All of these lymphomata can produce immunoglobulins. Sixty-seven cases showed an Ig increase in the tumour. This was mostly IgM, but sometimes IgG, IgA, IgD and/or IgE.

The absolute mean values of the areas of whole cells, areas of the nucleus and nucleolus, areas of the heterochromatin and other indices show that different cell clones will undergo leukaemic transformation.",
    "output": "The lymphoblastic type of acute leukemia is more sensitive to therapy, according to the morphometric investigation described in the context. This sensitivity is attributed to the presence of more central \"scattered\" heterochromatin in the early phases of the lymphoblastic cells, as compared to other types of paramyeloblasts."

In 11 (44%) of the patients, two populations of mature neutrophils were detected. The abnormal cells were identified by complete deficiency of one or more markers and constituted 10%-100% of the total number of neutrophils. This immunocytochemical approach may permit recognition of mature cells derived from leukemic clones, and serial determinations of the ratio of normal to abnormal cells may be useful in the management of patients with leukemia.",

    "input": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia can be subdivided into groups with different prognoses and clinical courses by immunological cell-markers. Patients with blasts, expressing T-cell-markers in a high density (T-cell leukemia), had an increased incidence of meningeal relapses, tumor formation in abdomen or mediastinum. T-lymphoblastic lymphoma is the same disease only different in initial presentation. After combination chemotherapy over one year, lymphocytes populations with no immunological cell-markers are relatively increased. Regular monitoring of the immunological subgroups of lymphocytes seems to be unhelpful in early diagnosis of periods with increased risk of severe infections.",
    "output": "The disease that is the same as T-cell leukemia but differs in initial presentation is known as T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. This disease, like T-cell leukemia, involves the abnormal proliferation of T-lymphocytes, but it initially presents as a lymphoma rather than a leukemia. Both conditions share similarities in their cellular origin and treatment, but their clinical presentations differ."

    "input": "A child presented with \"acute leukemia\" in which the blast cells resembled lymphoblasts and had negative cytochemical staining (PAS, Sudan black, and myeloperoxidase). Remission was induced and typical adult-type chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) followed. Cytogenetic studies initially and during remission and subsequent \"acute leukemia\" relapses revealed the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome abnormality. Terminal transferase assay performed on peripheral blood blast cells was markedly elevated and soft agar culture growth parameters were typical of acute lymphoblastic leukemia T and B cell marker studies revealed no markers. This case report with supportive laboratory studies suggests that a cell line with lymphoid characteristics may predominate during acute leukemic transformation. This type of subclassification of leukemia may be of importance in therapeutic planning.",
    "output": "The child initially presented with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Although the blast cells initially resembled lymphoblasts, they lacked T and B cell markers. The presence of the Philadelphia chromosome abnormality and the response to treatment typically associated with ALL also support this diagnosis. The subsequent development of typical adult-type chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) indicates a transformation from ALL to CML."

It is possible that this Ig class corresponds to the human IgD and the mouse IgD-like cell surface molecules. Small amounts of thedetected cell surface IgG may indicate both its cytophilic properties and the immunological status of the experimental animals.",
    "output": "The two main immunoglobulin classes found on the surface of normal rat splenocytes are monomeric IgM and Ig (H2L2). These immunoglobulins are distinguishable from each other and from other chains due to their antigenic properties and the size of their heavy chains. The heavy chain of Ig (H2L2) is larger than the phi chain but smaller than the mu chain. It is suggested that this Ig class may correspond to the human IgD and the mouse IgD-like cell surface molecules. Small amounts of detected cell surface IgG may indicate both its cytophilic properties and the immunological status of the experimental animals."

It was detected by agglutination of the cells with rabbit antibodies to mouse IgG and by a radioimmunoassay with 125I-labelled rabbit antibodies to mouse IgG. As shown by the degree of agglutination and of binding of radiolabeled antibodies to the erythrocyte membranes, the amount of Ig increased with time after infection and paralleled parasitemia and reticulocytosis. The erythrocyte-associated immunoglobulins are mainly IgG but IgM was also present on the cells of some mice. A large proportion of the Ig could be eluted at 37 degrees C and was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and acrylamide gel electrophoresis. A radioautographic study with 125I-labeled anti-mouse IgG revealed that both parasitized and nonparasitized reticulocytes of infected mice had much larger amounts of membrane-bound immunoglobulin than did mature, nonparasitized erythrocytes. The nature of the bonds between the Ig and the surface membrane of the reticulocytes is not known. The Ig could be part of immune complexes nonspecifically bound to the cell surface. However, since we have not detected Fc or C3d receptors on reticulocytes, it is possible that the Ig constitutes autoantibodies against reticulocytes or antibodies against parasitic antigens present on the cell membrane.",

Used in an indirect technique, an anti-IgM and an anti-HTLA (human T lymphocyte antigen) antiserum gave complementary patterns of membrane IF, characteristic of the follicular organization. When serial sections were stained for each of the five classes, immunoglobulin-containing cells from all classes were found. Their relative frequencies were, in decreasing order: IgG: 61.6%; IgA: 17.3%; IgM: 12%; IgE: 7.5%; IgD: 1.6%. These differed from those of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (IgA greater than IgG greater than IgM) and of the peripheral lymph nodes (IgG greater than IgM greater than IgA), but were close to those of mesenteric nodes. The absence of secretory component in tonsil was an additional difference from gut-associated lymphoid tissue and the relatively high proportion of IgE-containing cells, in the absence of recognized atopy, is another feature in common with mesenteric lymph nodes. Finally, slight differences between these results and those obtained on tonsil cell suspensions suggest that some degree of selection probably occurs during the isolation procedure.",

    "input": "Lymphocyte preparations isolated from the human peripheral blood were exposed to different acid pH or incubated at 37 degrees C and the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) on the cell surface was examined by immunofluorescence (IF) tests. Subsequently, such treated cells were incubated in the autologous serum or in the purified IgG, IgA or IgM proteins and their ability to bind each class of Ig was examined. The results showed that IgG molecules dissociated from large proportions of IgG-positive cells upon exposure to pH 4 at 1 degrees C for 1 min or upon incubation at 37 degrees C for 20 min. The cells from which IgG had been dissociated could again combine with IgG, whereupon the number of positive cells increased, being restored to the number of equivalent to or higher than those before acid or 37 degrees C treatment. These results indicated that the treatment could elute the cell-bound IgG present on the cell and that the receptor sites were not degraded by the treatment and could combine with IgG. These cell-bound IgG were observed not only on the monocytes, but also on the small lymphocytes. It was also found that certain proportions of mononuclear cells carried the cell-bound IgA that could be dissociated with acid pH or 37 degrees C. No cell-bound IgM was observed on any mononuclear cells. Microscopic observations before and after acid or 37 degrees C treatment revealed that the staining distribution of the cell-bound IgG and IgA on the cell was granular, appearing as a discontinuous fluorescence ring and forming multiple aggregates but no typical polar caps on warming. In contrast, IgG, IgA, and IgM stable to acid or 37 degrees C treatment were found on the lymphocytes but not on the monocytes, and their staining distribution was uniformaly diffuse, appearing as a continuous ring and forming a typical cap on warming. Exposure of the cells to pH 4 or 37 degrees C could also elute the cell-bound IgG passively adsorbed to the human lymphoid cells in a culture, but did not affect the intrinsic S.Ig on the lymphoid cells in a culture or on the lymphoma cells. These results indicate that the exposure of the cells to acid pH or to 37 degrees C may enable us to detect unfailingly S.Ig lymphocytes by removing the cell-bound IgG and IgA present on the monocytes and/or lymphocytes. Thus, an average value of approximately 10% was obtained for the S.Ig lymphocyte in the lymphocyte preparations from 11 healthy individuals. In addition, the results provided the evidence that, even in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, there may be a population of B lymphocytes which lack the S.Ig but carry the cell-bound Ig.",

Lymphocytes of seven species: mouse, rat, guinea pig, pig, cow, monkey, and human, and of ten human lymphoma-derived lines were tested. Analysis of the differential expression of surface markers revealed a reproducible reaction of protein A with cell-surface Fc of IgG actively produced by lymphoid cells from human, monkey, guinea pig, and pig, and with passively attached IgG molecules in the form of antibodies, directed against cell surface antigens of all lymphoid cells tested. No surface Ig was detected on so-called T lymphocytes. The distribution of cell-bound Ig density among surface Ig-positive cells was found to be different depending upon the origin of the cells with regard to lymphoid organ; it was parallel among the lymphoma lines tested and on peripheral blood cells from human, monkey, and pig, although large variations in fluorescence intensity among individual cells and among the different lines were recorded. Beta2-microglobulin determinants were found equally well on enriched human T and B cells.

A panel of fourteen IgG preparations of the four gamma chain subclasses were prepared from myeloma sera and used as inhibitors of haemagglutination. Each of six IgM anti-globulins demonstrated different reactivity profiles with these IgG preparations. In addition, the fraction of the serum IgG which had bound to and cryoprecipitated with the IgM preparations, termed 'antigen-IgG', was purified and assayed for subclass content. The gamma chain subclasses found in the 'antigen-IgG' fractions showed that each IgM cryoprecipitated an IgG from serum which had different quantities of the subclasses present. These 'autologous' reactivity patterns were in instances different from the specificities expected from the results obtained with the myeloma proteins. When all antigen-IgG pools were tested with each IgM, some antiglobulins showed stronger reactivity with isologous than with their own, antigen-IgG pools. The IgM anti-IgG preparations were also compared in reactivity with IgG and its subunits in order to localize the antigenic determinant(s) with which these autoantibodies react. Heavy chains showed far greater reactivity than Fc fragment for 5/6 IgM preparations. Light chains, F(ab')2, pFc' and Fab were non-reactive. A relationship between the length of papain digestion and Fc reactivity was demonstrated. Based on the data, possible locations for the antigenic determinant(s) were considered.",

    "input": "IgM/IgD-bearing lymphocytes (B cells) from children in the first few weeks of life were found to also have surface IgG, unlike most normal adult B cells. The IgG was loosely bound to the lymphocyte surface and was partially or completely removed by incubation at 37 degrees C or by trypsinization. When F(ab')2 antisera were employed, very few infant B cells had surface IgG, although the IgM staining was similar to that obtained with the native antisera. IgM/IgD-positive cells bound IgG anti-Rh-coated (Ripley) erythrocytes, unlike most adult B lymphocytes. Capping experiments suggested that an Fc receptor on the cells could be redistributed by the anti-IgM-surface IgM complex. These data indicate that, during infancy, B-lymphocyte receptors for IgG are of altered affinity, frequency, or availability compared with adult B-lymphocyte Fc receptors and resemble the Fc receptors found on \"third population\" (Fc + Ig-) mononuclear cells and monocytes.",
    "output": "In the context provided, it is stated that when infant B cells were incubated at 37 degrees C or treated with trypsinization, the surface IgG on these cells was either partially or completely removed. This suggests that the surface IgG on infant B cells is loosely bound and can be easily detached under these conditions.

    "input": "Procedures are detailed for the rapid isolation of representative cell membrane antigens with protein A-bearing staphylococci as an adsorbent for IgG antibodies complexed with the antigens. Cell surface membrane proteins were radioiodinated and solubilized in nonionic detergent. Specific antisera were subsequently added and the immune complexes precipitated by addition of the staphylococcal adsorbent and low speed centrifugation. The antigens isolated included surface immunoglobulins from mouse and human lymphocytes, human beta-microglobulin and HL-A alloantigens, mouse H-2 alloantigens, and the murine leukemia virus glycoprotein gp 70. Rabbit, sheep, goat, and mouse antisera were all effective for the specific phase of the precipitation reaction. The surface membrane immunoglobulins of mouse splenic lymphocytes and human peripheral blood lymphocytes differed with respect to class composition and protein A reactivity. Mouse lymphocyte surface immunoglobulins were nonreactive with protein A, whereas a high proportion of human lymphocyte surface immunoglobulins of different classes bound directly to the staphylococci. In sequential immunoprecipitation studies the prior isolation of one antigen had no appreciable effect on the subsequent recovery of another antigen. Adsorption of antigen-antibody complexes is quantitative when protein A sites are provided in excess over antiserum IgG sites, and this obviates the need for equivalence point titrations for optimal precipitation necessary with alternative double antibody techniques.",
    "output": "In sequential immunoprecipitation studies, the prior isolation of one antigen had no appreciable effect on the subsequent recovery of another antigen. This suggests that the process of isolating one antigen does not interfere with the ability to isolate other antigens in the subsequent steps. The procedure allows for the isolation of various antigens, including surface immunoglobulins from mouse and human lymphocytes, human beta-microglobulin and HL-A alloantigens, mouse H-2 alloantigens, and the murine leukemia virus glycoprotein gp 70, without significant interference between antigens."

As shown by the use of liposomes containing H3-inulin and immunoglobulins against the cell surface determinants, these immuno-liposomes selectively bound the target, but not the control cells. Specific binding with the antigenic cell surface determinants was also demonstrated in the case of liposomes bearing the nonimmune globulins besides the immunoglobulins. By the indirect immunofluorescence method it was shown that the nonimmune globulins in complex with the immune liposomes were selectively bound by target cells. A possible use of the immuno-liposomes to deliver various substances selectively to the cells of particular types, and to incorporate new antigens into the cell membrane is discussed.",

    "input": "Conformationally altered IgG molecules have been detected in the serum of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A hypothesis is presented that specific T-cell unresponsiveness to autologous IgG can be bypassed through the recognition of the altered IgG by competent B lymphocytes. The recognition of altered IgG is mediated through membrane Fc receptors (which may themselves be different in rheumatoid arthritis) and this favours stimulation of those cells carrying a specific receptor for an antigenic part of the molecule. A particular cellular arrangement may be required for complete antigenic stimulation and antiglobulin production. The resultant antiglobulin can have the same binding affinity for autologous and homologous IgG since the antigenic part of the molecule need not be a structurally altered site.",
    "output": "The type of receptors that mediate the recognition of altered IgG by competent B lymphocytes are membrane Fc receptors. Specifically, they are Fc\u03b3 receptors, which are a family of receptors that bind the Fc region of IgG. In the context provided, it's suggested that these receptors may be different in rheumatoid arthritis. The recognition of altered IgG through these receptors can lead to stimulation of B lymphocytes and subsequent production of antiglobulin, which can bind to both autologous and homologous IgG."

These forces are psychological, sociocultural, or part of the medical care process. Optimal management of the symptomatic and somatizing patient thus entails obtaining psychological information about emotional precipitants, relevant childhood experiences, psychiatric disorders, and the personal meaning of the symptom; searching for the somatizing personality themes of masochism and guilt, hostility, and dependence; understanding the patient's goals in obtaining medical care, such as information and explanation, psychological counseling, or social and administrative intervention; and assessing situational stress, secondary gain, and ethnic and cultural forces that foster the amplification of physical symptoms.",

The measurement of pain is dependent on factors affecting pain complaint, and the psychiatrist can only accept the patient's experience. The reaction inhibition test and Chapman's Somatic, Anxiety, Depression (SAD) index provide ways of elucidating the functional versus organic dilemma.

The results of etiological research have not, as yet, progressed so far as to provide measures of primary prevention, whereas the results of research into the course of schizophrenia have already led to practical consequences for therapy resp. rehabilitation of schizophrenic patients. In future, with a decrease in the number of long-stay hospitalizations, the number of schizophrenic out-patients, resp. of prolonged periods of out-patient treatments will increase accordingly. Thus hitherto known influencing factors and treatment strategies will also be due to change. According to present knowledge, etiology, psychopathology, course and outcome of schizophrenia represent a very complex and variable, multifactorially initiated process, in which illness-related and environment-related factors concur. Drafts of new models and instruments for the assessment of this process and subsequent disabilities as well as methodological difficulties herewith are reported.",

Besides the desired improvement of pre-, intra- and postoperative diagnosis multiple therapeutic procedures proved to be practicable. Of special interest are those methods, which can be used successfully in emergency cases. Here the foreign body dislodgement, the stopping of hemorrhage and the introduction of tubes in cases of ileus or dehiscence of the suture have to be mentioned. The endoscopic treatment is very often a complementary or palliative one and not so much an alternative. These methods are applied to patients at high risk.",

    "instruction": "What is one measure to reduce both mortality and morbidity associated with tracheotomy?",
    "input": "Complications associated with tracheotomy are reduced by prompt operation when indications develop, by meticulous technical performance of operation and careful postoperative care. The selection of intratracheal tube according to size and form is one measure to reduce both mortality and morbidity. Among the complications are dry hemorrhagic tracheobronchitis with crusts, severe arrosion bleeding and quite frequently secondary tracheal stenosis. In some cases it is more advisable to perform the tracheostomy in which the trachea is brought to the skin and sewed in place-providing a permanent opening.",
    "output": "One measure to reduce both mortality and morbidity associated with tracheotomy is selecting the appropriate size and form of the intratracheal tube during the procedure. This careful selection helps minimize complications such as dry hemorrhagic tracheobronchitis, severe arrosion bleeding, and secondary tracheal stenosis. Additionally, performing the tracheostomy in a way that brings the trachea to the skin and sews it in place may provide a more stable, permanent opening, which could also contribute to a reduced risk of complications."

    "input": "Difficulties commonly encountered in transhepatic catheterization of the portal vein and interpretation of portograms are discussed. A long-sleeved trocar is recommended. Curved guide wires and deflector assemblies may assist in superselective catheterization of the tributaries of the portal vein. The judicious use of embolic material (small volumes, slowly injected) should guarantee the success and safety of this technique. Transhepatic obliteration of the gastroesophageal veins is a relatively simple and usually successful form of palliative treatment for actively bleeding and stable gastroesophageal varices. Thoroughness of the embolization procedure and of interruption of blood flow in the gastroesophageal veins is necessary to prevent early recurrence of bleeding.",
    "output": "To assist in superselective catheterization of the tributaries of the portal vein, curved guide wires and deflector assemblies can be used. These tools help navigate the complex branching patterns within the portal vein system. Additionally, the use of a long-sleeved trocar can also aid in this procedure. The judicious use of embolic material, injected in small volumes slowly, can further ensure the success and safety of the procedure."

Experience with two such patients suggests that the complication can best be treated by proper placement of the tube so that it seals the leak and bypasses the obstruction. Judicious use of antibiotics is beneficial. Drainage of the mediastinum may also be necessary. Resectional or extensive operative therapy is probably not wise in these ill and debilitated patients, particularly if the cancer is incurable.",

In addition to relieving the bladder in subvesical obstructions the most important indication in practise is continuous drainage of urine in patients in intensive care. With strict observation of puncture technique and contraindications (contracted bladder, tumors in the lower abdomen, bladder carcinoma, macrohematuria and hemorrhagic diathesis) the entire complication rate is 4.3% (2.3% macrohematuria, 1.5% local infection, 0.5% peritoneal lesion). With the introduction of the disposable puncture systems the suprapubic bladder fistula has become a superior alternative to the indwelling catheter in many cases.",

Hyperplasia and lamination of Bowman's membrane, corneal endothelial dystrophy with degenerative changes in the posterior stroma, hypoplasia of the retinal ganglion cell and nerve fibre layers, and severe changes in the retinal and iris blood vessels are believed to be pathognomonic ocular features of this syndrome, in addition to cataract and signs of immaturity. These findings are compared with the few descriptions of the syndrome previously published. The corneal damage is postulated to result indirectly from oligohydramnios which causes chronic compression of the globes and thus endothelial damage due to contact with the spherical cataracts. The pathological changes in the retinal and iris vessels are either genetically determined or the result of chronic hypoxia.",
    "output": "The corneal damage in reno-facial dysplasia is believed to be caused indirectly by oligohydramnios, a condition characterized by low amniotic fluid. This low amniotic fluid leads to chronic compression of the globes (eyeballs), which results in endothelial damage due to contact with the spherical cataracts."

    "instruction": "At what time of day do the epithelial erosions nearly always reoccur?",
    "input": "In the majority of cases there exists, at the beginning of the recurrent dystrophic erosion of the corneal epithelium, a slight superficial trauma. There are, neverthless, also spontaneous forms, which are more often bilateral, hereditary forms and secondary forms with more generalized corneal dystrophies. (2) Between the trauma and the appearance of the recurrent  erosion there is always a latency period of variable duration. (3) Women are more often affected than men. The condition usually is observed between 25 and 40 years of age. (4) The epithelial erosions reoccur at irregular intervals nearly always in the morning when the eyes are opened. They are always localized below the pupillary area and not necessarily at the site of the trauma. (5) Between two recurrences, there persists a latent epithelial dystrophy, which is characterized by subjective symptoms (pricking pain in the morning at the opening of the eyes) and by objective signs (grey epithelial spots or epithelial microbullae below the pupillary area near the vertical meridian). (6) At the light and electron microscope one sees alterations of the basal epithelial cells, intra epithelial cysts, ruptures of the basement membrane and disappearance of the hemidesmosomes. (7) The disorder is a true epithelial dystrophy, the traumatism being only an occasional cause. (8) The treatment is discussed.",

    "input": "A study was made of the retinal functions in 4 patients with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, general myopathy, EEG anomalies and pigment changes of the fundus oculi (ophthalmoplegia-plus). Three of them exhibited typical, granular pigmentations in a linear or reticular arrangement at the periphery. All four showed slight to moderate pigment epithelial defects in the maculae, mostly only discernible with fluorescence angiography. In all 4 cases, a slight decrease of the visual acuity, a mildly abnormal ERG, mild concentric restriction of the field of vision and, in two cases, an abnormal dark-adaptation curve led to the conclusion of a mild diffuse, widely disseminated receptor affection of the retina (both rods and cones). The EOG appeared normal in 3, and at the lower limit of normal in 1 case. On the basis of a detailed study of the literature we can conclude that the retinal lesions in chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia may vary from benign pigmentations without functional impairment to genuine 'retinitis pigmentosa' with all gradations of rod-cone or cone-rod dystrophy. Emphasis is laid on the possibility of a correlation between the mitochondrial abnormalities encountered in ocular myopathy and ophthalmoplegia-plus on the one hand, and the retinal abnormalities on the other, with special reference to a possible disorder of the utilization of pyruvate in the citric-acid cycle and a loose coupling of the oxidative phosphorylation.",

Sessions were terminated after 50 water deliveries or 30 min had elapsed. Performance was well-maintained in all monkeys. Allowing the animals access to water prior to the session had no effect on performance. Discontinuing sessions for two weeks disrupted some aspects of performance but responding improved within 5 sessions. Single injections of methamphetamine (0.06-0.5 mg/kg) were given IM 20 min prior to the session. The highest dose of 0.5 mg/kg totally eliminated responding. Lower doses decreased rate of responding somewhat and increased phasic activity (i.e., tremors) in a dose-dependent manner. The procedure seems ideally suited for investigating the effects of psychotropic drugs on fine motor control in rhesus monkeys.",

Three served as controls. Five of the ten arrested animals survived and were tested in the discrimination box. All continued to perform color and pattern discrimination tasks with one to eight days' delay. All appeared neurologically intact, while brain pathologic examination after 11 to 64 days' survival showed either intact brains or injury restricted to nuclear structures in the brain stem, cerebellar Purkinje cells, and hippocampus. Five animals died 4 to 36 hours after they were resuscitated. Two required prolonged cardiac massage and, despite return of adequate cardiovascular function, died early. A third animal dislodged its arterial catheter and exsanguinated.

The levels finally oscillated within a narrow range around the threshold. The auditory thresholds of rats were increased by intramuscular administration of quinidine at 20 mg/kg and also by repeated intramuscular administration of kanamycin at 250 and 500 mg/kg/day. In rhesus monkeys, visual thresholds were raised by application of pilocarpine at 0.02-0.16 mg/kg to the eyes and also by subcutaneous administration of LSD-25 at 4-8 micrograms/kg in one monkey and at 20-30 micrograms/kg in another.

Addition of acetyl-CoA increases the biosynthesis and palmityl-CoA when added causes an inhibition. -- The other system, using acetyl-CoA, elongates exogenous palmityl-CoA ; endogenous acyl-CoAs are not elongated by acetyl-CoA. All these results are confirmed by radiogas chromatographic studies of the reactions products.",

    "instruction": "What percentage of total enzyme activity was found in the mitochondria at 0.5mm-acetyl-CoA?",
    "input": "Whole liver and isolated liver mitochondria are able to release free acetate, especially under conditions of increased fatty acid oxidation. In the present paper it is shown that rat liver contains acetyl-CoA deacylase (EC 3.1.2.1) activity (0.72mumol/min per g wet wt. of liver at 30 degrees C and 0.5mm-acetyl-CoA). At 0.5mm-acetyl-CoA 73% of total enzyme activity was found in the mitochondria, 8% in the lysosomal fraction and 19% in the postmicrosomal supernatant. Mitochondrial subfractionation shows that mitochondrial acetyl-CoA deacylase activity is restricted to the matrix space. Mitochondrial acetyl-CoA deacylase showed almost no activity with either butyryl- or hexanoyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA hydrolase activity from purified rat liver lysosomes exhibited a very low affinity for acetyl-CoA (apparent K(m)>15mm compared with an apparent K(m) value of 0.5mm for the mitochondrial enzyme) and reacted at about the same rate with acetyl-, n-butyryl- and hexanoyl-CoA. We could not confirm the findings of Costa & Snoswell [(1975) Biochem. J.152, 167-172] according to which mitochondrial acetyl-CoA deacylase was considered to be an artifact resulting from the combined actions of acetyl-CoA-l-carnitine acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.7) and acetylcarnitine hydrolase. The results are in line with the concept that free acetate released by the liver under physiological conditions stems from the intramitochondrial deacylation of acetyl-CoA.",

    "instruction": "What is the effect of insulin administration on the adipose desaturase activity?",
    "input": "Porcine and rat microsomal stearyl-CoA desaturases require reduced pyridine nucleotide and oxygen, are cyanide sensitive, and are insensitive to carbon monoxide. The Km for stearyl-CoA is somewhat larger for liver than for the adipose desaturases, but, in general, assay conditions are quite similar. Adipose tissue microsomes contain cytochromes b5 and P-450, as well as the NADH- and NADPH-specific cytochrome reductases. Compared to liver, the specific contents and activities of electron carriers are much lower in adipose tissue, and activities of 4-methyl sterol oxidase of cholesterol biosynthesis, as well as the cytochrome P-450-dependent aminopyrene demethylase and benzypyrene hydroxylase, are negligible in adipose tissue microsomes. Furthermore, unlike hepatic desaturase, administration of insulin stimulates the adipose desaturase 3-fold without affecting either the amounts or activities of microsomal oxidation-reduction proteins; the changes in desaturase activities produced either by altering dietary fat or by fasting and/or fasting followed by refeeding are, in general, both more extensive and more permanent in adipose compared to liver microsomes. The effects produced by isotopic hydrogen substitution both in stearyl-CoA and in the medium (2H2O) are similar with microsomes from both tissues. The rate-determining step of desaturase appears to be similar in both tissues. The primary isotope effect, k H/Tr, observed with [9,10-3H2]stearyl-CoA is relatively small, 2.88. Since little, if any, primary isotope effect is associated with methyl sterol oxidase, these two mixed function oxidases of biosynthetic processes also appear to share this property in common.",
    "output": "Insulin administration stimulates the activity of adipose desaturase by approximately 3-fold, unlike the hepatic desaturase. This stimulation occurs without affecting the amounts or activities of microsomal oxidation-reduction proteins in adipose tissue. The rate-determining step of desaturase appears to be similar in both adipose and liver tissues. The primary isotope effect observed with [9,10-3H2]stearyl-CoA is relatively small, 2.88, suggesting that the primary isotope effect is shared by both adipose and liver desaturases."

    "input": "The process leading to the rise of acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity in rat mammary tissue after the onset of lactation was investigated. The kinetics of change in enzyme activity and enzyme immunotitratable with antibody against avian liver acetyl-CoA carboxylase were determined during the course of lactogenic differentiation. The antibody inactivates and specifically precipitates acetyl-CoA carboxylase from rat mammary tissue as well as that from chicken liver cytosol. Characterization of the immunoprecipitate of the mammary tissue carboxylase by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis reveals a single biotin-containing polypeptide of about 230000mol.wt. This molecular weight is approximately twice that reported for the avian liver enzyme. However, chicken liver cytosol prepared in the presence of trypsin inhibitor and subjected to immunoprecipitation gives rise to a biotin-containing subunit of 230000mol.wt. as determined by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis; omission of proteinase inhibitor leads to a subunit(s) approximately one-half this size. Throughout gestation both carboxylase activity and amounts of immunotitratable enzyme remained low; however, after parturition both parameters rose concomitantly to values 30-40 times the initial values. Therefore the elevated concentration of acetyl-CoA carboxylase appears to result from an increased rate of synthesis of enzyme relative to degradation rather than to activation of a pre-existing form of the enzyme.",
    "output": "In the absence of trypsin inhibitor, the molecular weight of the biotin-containing subunit of chicken liver cytosol acetyl-CoA carboxylase is approximately one-half the size of the subunit prepared in the presence of trypsin inhibitor. This suggests that trypsin may be causing degradation of the enzyme, resulting in smaller subunits. However, without further experimentation, it is not possible to definitively state the exact mechanism of this degradation."

    "input": "Acetyl-CoA synthase (EC 6.2.1.1), Propionyl-CoA synthase (EC 6.2.1.-) and butyryl-CoA synthase (EC 6.2.1.2) were measured in subcellular fractions prepared by primary and density-gradient fractionation from adult rat brain by a method resulting in recoveries close to 100%. Most of the activity of the three enzymes was recovered in the crude mitochondrial fraction. On subfractionation of this crude mitochondrial fraction with continuous sucrose density gradients, most of the activity of the three enzymes was found at a higher density than NAD+-isocitrate dehydrogenase and at about the same density as glutamate dehydrogenase, confirming earlier reported data for acetyl-CoA synthase. The finding that propionyl-CoA synthase and butyryl-CoA synthase had about the same distribution in the gradients as acetyl-CoA synthase adds support to the hypothesis that mitochondria involved in the metabolism of these short-chain fatty acids (all three of which have been shown to result in a rapid and high labelling of glutamine in vivo) form a distinct subpopulation of the total mitochondrial population. The three synthase activities were found to differ from each other in their rate of change and their subcellular localization during rat brain development. This, in combination with the observation that in gradients of adult brain preparations the three activities did not completely overlap, suggests that the three synthase activities are not present in the same proportion to each other in the same subpopulation (s) of mitochondria in the brain.",
    "output": "The enzyme used as a comparison for the density of the three synthase activities in the subfractionation of the crude mitochondrial fraction was NAD+-isocitrate dehydrogenase.

    "input": "The activities of cytosolic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase [3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA acetoacetyl-CoA-lyase (CoA-acylating), EC 4.1.3.5] and microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase[mevalonate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (CoA-acylating), EC 1.1.1.34], two sequential enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, were shown to be regulated coordinately in the adrenal gland of the rat. When the plasma cholesterol level was lowered by administration of 4-aminopyrazolopyrimidine, a treatment known to enhance cholesterol synthesis in the adrenal, synthase activity in the gland rose by 14- to 29-fold and reductase activity rose by 50- to 100-fold. The subsequent intravenous infusion of low density lipoprotein restored the plasma cholesterol level and suppressed synthase and reductase activities in parallel. The activities of adrenal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase and reductase were also shown to exhibit a coordinate pattern of diurnal variation with peaks in both enzymes achieved at the mid-point of the dark cycle. The activity of adrenal acetoacetyl coenzyme A thiolase (acetyl CoA acetyltransferase; acetyl-CoA:acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.9), the enzyme preceding the synthase in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, and the activity of adrenal mevalonate kinase (ATP:mevalonate 5-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.36), the enzyme following the reductase, were not enhanced by cholesterol deprivation, and neither exhibited a pattern of diurnal variation. The coordinate control of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase and reductase in rat adrenal gland provides a model system to study the biochemical mechanism for the regulation of cholesterol synthesis in a tissue that uses cholesterol for the synthesis of steroid hormones.",
    "output": "The context suggests that lowering plasma cholesterol level in rats through the administration of 4-aminopyrazolopyrimidine results in a significant increase in the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase in the adrenal gland. This increase ranges from 14- to 29-fold. The activity of another enzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, also increases in response, with a 50- to 100-fold increase. This coordinated increase in the activity of these two enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is a response to the lowered plasma cholesterol level. The infusion of low-density lipoprotein restores the plasma cholesterol level and suppresses the activities of both enzymes in parallel. The activities of other enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, such as acetoacetyl coenzyme A thiolase and mevalonate kinase, are not affected by cholesterol deprivation and do not exhibit a pattern of diurnal variation."

    "instruction": "What is the approximate level of malonyl CoA in the liver of a normally fed rat, in nmoles per gram of wet liver?",
    "input": "The objects of structural studies on biotin-enzymes were acetyl CoA-carboxylase and pyruvate carboxylase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and beta-methylcrotonyl CoA-carboxylase and acetyl CoA-carboxylase of Achromobacter IV S. It was found that these enzymes can be arranged in three groups. In the first group, as represented by acetyl CoA-carboxylase of Achromobacter, the active enzyme could be resolved in three types of functional components: (1) the biotin-carboxyl carrier protein, (2) the biotin carboxylase, and (3) the carboxyl transferase. In the second group, as represented by beta-methylcrotonyl CoA-carboxylase from Achromobacter only two types of polypeptides are present. The one carries the biotin carboxylase activity together with the biotin-carboxyl-carrier protein, the other one carries the carboxyl transferase activity. In this third group, as represented by the two enzymes of yeast, all three catalytic functions are incorporated in one multifunctional polypeptide chain. The evolution of the different enzymes is discussed. The animal tissues acetyl CoA-carboxylase is under metabolic control, as known from previous studies. It thus has to be expected that the levels of malonyl CoA in livers of rats in all states of depressed fatty acid synthesis are much lower than under normal conditions because the carboxylation of acetyl CoA is strongly reduced and cannot keep pace with the consumption of malonyl CoA by fatty acid synthetase. A new highly sensitive assay method for malonyl CoA was developed which uses tritiated NADPH and measures the incorporation of radioactivity into the fatty acids formed from malonyl CoA in the presence of purified fatty acid synthetase. The application of this method to liver extracts showed that the level of malonyl CoA which amounts to about 7 nmoles per gram of wet liver drops to less than 10% within a starvation period of 24 hr and even further if the starvation period is extended to 48 hr. A low malonyl CoA concentration is also found in the alloxan diabetic animals and in animals being fed a fatty diet after starvation. On the other hand, feeding a carbohydrate rich diet leads to malonyl CoA levels surpassing the levels found after feeding a balanced diet. These observations reconfirm the concept that fatty acid synthesis is principally regulated by the carboxylation of acetyl CoA.",

    "instruction": "What concentration of theophylline was added to the culture medium of C-6 glial cells?",
    "input": "The long-term regulation of fatty acid synthetase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase and of fatty acid and sterol synthesis was studied in C-6 glial cells in culture. When theophylline (10(-3) M) was added to the culture medium of these cells, rates of lipid synthesis from acetate and activities of synthetase and carboxylase became distinctly lower than in cells that were untreated. This effect appeared after approximately 12 h, and after 48 h enzymatic activities were reduced approx. 2-fold and rates of lipid synthesis from acetate 3- to 4-fold. The likelihood that the decrease in fatty acid synthesis from acetate was caused by the decrease in activities of fatty acid synthetase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase was established by several observations. These indicated that the locus of the effect probably did not reside at the level of acetate uptake into the cell, alterations in acetate pool sizes or conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA. Moreover, de novo fatty acid synthesis was found to be the predominant pathway in these glial cells, whether treated with theophylline or not. The mechanism of the effect of theophylline on fatty acid synthetase was shown by immunochemical techniques to involve an alteration in content of enzyme rather than in catalytic efficiency. The change in content of fatty acid synthetase was shown by isotopic-immunochemical experiments to involve a decrease in synthesis of the enzyme. The mechanism whereby theophylline leads to a decrease in lipogenesis and in the synthesis of fatty acid synthetase may not be mediated entirely by inhibition of phosphodiesterase and an increase in cyclic AMP levels, because dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10(-3) M) only partially reproduced the effect.",

The enzyme was associated with the microsomal fraction and could not be solubilized. Metal ions, EDTA and detergents did not significantly affect the enzyme activity. p-Chloromercuribenzoate and N-ethylmaleimide inhibited the enzyme. 3. Other S-substituted cysteines were acetylated at about the same rate as S-benzyl-L-cysteine. Acetylation of cysteine itself and of methionine, ethionine and tryptophan could be detected but was much slower. Acetylation of aspartic acid, glycine, phenylalanine and serine could not be detected. Palmitoyl-CoA was not a substrate. 4. The enzyme is presumably responsible for the acetylation step of mercapturic acid synthesis; a more physiological function is not yet known, except that the enzyme may be involved in acetylation of those amino acids which occur in elevated amounts in some disorders of amino acid metabolism.",

To define the relationship between the hemoglobinopathy and glomerular disease, clinicopathologic correlations, renal morphologic, ultrastructural immunohistologic and functional studies were performed on seven patients with clinical and laboratory evidence of glomerular disease. In addition, immunologic studies including isolation and characterization of cryoprecipitable immune complexes, and determination of immunoglobulin, total complement and complement component levels, and antibody titers to several antigens were performed in an attempt to define the etiologic and pathogenic mechanisms of the renal disease and its relationship to sickle cell anemia. Proteinuria was presnet in all patients. The nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, hematuria and renal insufficiency were found in more than one half the patients. All patients had membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis of varying degree; glomerular basement membrane splitting, electron dense deposits in the glomerulus; interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and hemosiderin deposits were frequent. Immunoglobulin complement components (classif complement pathway) and renal tubular epithelial antigen were distributed in a granular pattern along the glomerular basement membranes of all patients studied by these methods. Cyroprecipitable complexes of renal tubular epithelial antigen-antibody to renal tubular epithelial antigen as well as antibody to renal epithelial antigen were detected in the circulation of some patients. There was no serologic evidence of activation of the alternate complement pathway. These studies demonstrated an immune deposit normocomplementemic nephritis associated with sickle cell anemia; they further support our hypothesis that the relationship is more then coincidental, and is mediated by glomerular deposition of immune complexes of renal tubular epithelial antigen-antibody to renal tubular epithelial antigen, the antigen possibly released after tubular damage secondary to oxygenation and hemodynamic alterations related to sickle cell disease.",
