Repository for training and deploying Generative AI models, including text-text, text-to-image generation, prompt engineering playground and chain of thought examples using SageMaker Studio.

## Sagemaker End-to-End MLOps Lifecycle

This directory provides sample notebooks showing users how to use SageMaker AI and SageMaker Unified Studio to achieve end-to-end AIOps/MLOps best practices. For example, several notebooks show how to call the SageMaker SDK(Python API) to create, modify, upload, and execute an ML Pipeline that implements standard ML lifecycle. These pipelines contain steps that perform: data preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, model creation, modelregistration, and batch transform operations.
