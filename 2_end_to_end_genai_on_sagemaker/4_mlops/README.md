## Sagemaker End-to-End MLOps Lifecycle

This directory provides sample notebooks showing users how to use SageMaker AI and SageMaker Unified Studio to achieve end-to-end AIOps/MLOps best practices. For example, several notebooks show how to call the SageMaker SDK(Python API) to create, modify, upload, and execute an ML Pipeline that implements standard ML lifecycle. These pipelines contain steps that perform: data preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, model creation, modelregistration, and batch transform operations. 

Sagemaker [Pipelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pipelines-overview.html) is a workflow orchestration tool used to automate the end-to-end building of ML models. A Pipelines consists of one or more Steps (see [StepTypes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/build-and-manage-steps.html) for more details) which are executed in a specified order.
